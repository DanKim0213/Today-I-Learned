## Solution

1. Based on programs,
   1. check if possible to put
   2. process the first program or update the current time
2. handle the remainings of PQ

```python
import heapq

def solution(program):
    answer = [0] * 11
    program.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))

    current = 0
    pq = []
    prg_idx = 0

    # program is depedent on current_time
    # Thus, we need to push a program whenever possible
    while prg_idx != len(program):
        while prg_idx < len(program) and current >= program[prg_idx][1]:
            heapq.heappush(pq, program[prg_idx])
            prg_idx += 1

        if pq:
            a, b, c = heapq.heappop(pq)
            # print(a, b, c)
            answer[a] += current - b
            current += c
        elif prg_idx < len(program) and current < program[prg_idx][1]:
            current = program[prg_idx][1]

    # handle remainings of pq
    while pq:
        a, b, c = heapq.heappop(pq)
        answer[a] += current - b
        current += c

    answer[0] = current
    return answer
```

## What I learned

1. I ran into `List Index out of range` error:

```python
while current >= program[prg_idx][1]:
  heapq.heappush(pq, program[prg_idx])
  prg_idx += 1
```

To fix this:

> while prg_idx < len(program) and current >= program[prg_idx][1]:

2. I learned how to set the priority using `heapq`, based on multiple factors:

```python
import heapq

pq = []
heapq.heappush(pq, (1, "bello"))
heapq.heappush(pq, (1, "aello"))
heapq.heappush(pq, (1, "cello"))

while pq:
  print(heapq.heappop(pq))

'''
(1, 'aello')
(1, 'bello')
(1, 'cello')
'''
```

3. The pitfall where I fell into is that I tried to reuse the priority queue

```python
import heapq

def solution(program):
    answer = [0] * 11
    pq = []
    end = 0

    # Warning!: this process increases the time complexity a lot
    for pr in program:
        a, b, c, = pr
        heapq.heappush(pq, (b, a, b, c))

    while pq:
        start, a, b, c = heapq.heappop(pq)
        if end > start:
        	heapq.heappush(pq, (end, a, b, c))
        elif end == start:
            answer[a] += end - b
            end += c
        else: # end < start
            end = b + c

    answer[0] = end
    return answer
```

The rule of thumb here is that to put an element into PQ when necessary. If not, don't!
