# Abstract Data Type (ADT) vs Data Structure (DS)

TL;DR; Behavior (ADT) vs Representation of Data (DS)

> "In computer science, an abstract data type (ADT) is a mathematical model for data types. An abstract data type is defined by **its behavior** (semantics) from the point of view of a user, of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations. 
> This mathematical model contrasts with data structures, which are **concrete representations of data**, and are the point of view of an implementer, not a user." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type)

## Examples 

### Abstract Data Type

- List, Map, Set, Graph, Tree, Stack, Queue, Priority Queue, Dobule-ended queue

### Data Structure

- Array, Linked List, Hash Tables, Record(also called *typle or struct*), Heap

## Heap vs Priority Queue

Heaps are concrete data structures, whereas priority queues are abstract data type.
