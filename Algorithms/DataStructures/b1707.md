TL;DR;

- Bipartite graph is that every edge connects a vertex in U to one in V with each different color.
- Bipartite graph can be solved by BFS or DFS.
- The given vertices from problems could possibly be grouped separately.

## What is Bipartite Graph

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph):

> In the mathematical field of graph theory, a bipartite graph (or bigraph) is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets U and V, that is, **every edge connects a vertex in U to one in V**. Vertex sets U and V are usually called the parts of the graph.

So, I notice that `BFS` or `DFS` works since Bipartite graph is required only to check its adjacent vertices if these have the same color.

I've seen marking color to either RED or BLUE in many examples. However, in my example, I'd like to group them seperately into '1' or '2' using `visited`:

```python
import sys
from collections import defaultdict, deque

input = sys.stdin.readline


def bfs(graph, visited, src):
    visited[src] = 1
    queue = deque([(src, 1)])

    while queue:
        cur, prev_color = queue.popleft()
        for adj in graph[cur]:
            if visited[adj] == 0:
                color = 1 if prev_color == 2 else 2
                visited[adj] = color
                queue.append((adj, color))
            else:
                if visited[adj] == prev_color:
                    return False

    return True


def solve():
    K = int(input())
    for _ in range(K):
        V, E = map(int, input().split())
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        visited = [0] * (V + 1)

        # all vertices could possibly not be given from the following edges
        for _ in range(E):
            u, v = map(int, input().split())
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)

        # Of course, some of them could be separted into parts
        # So, I loop all of them
        ans = True
        for i in range(1, V + 1):
            if visited[i] == 0:
                ans = ans and bfs(graph, visited, i)

        if ans:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")


solve()
```
