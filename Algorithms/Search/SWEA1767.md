## My solution

```python
from itertools import combinations

dx = [0, 0, -1, 1]
dy = [-1, 1, 0, 0]


def dfs(grid, idx, spots):
    if idx == len(spots):
        # print("----spots----:", spots)
        # for i in range(len(grid)):
        #     print(grid[i])
        return 0

    min_strokes = INF
    for i in range(4):
        new_grid = [row[:] for row in grid] # check 1
        current = strokeLine(new_grid, spots[idx], dx[i], dy[i])
        if current == INF:
            continue
        strokedLines = dfs(new_grid, idx + 1, spots)
        if strokedLines == INF:
            continue
        min_strokes = min(min_strokes, strokedLines + current)
    return min_strokes


def strokeLine(grid, spot, d_x, d_y):
    N = len(grid)
    lines = 0

    x, y = spot
    nx, ny = x + d_x, y + d_y
    while 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N:
        if grid[nx][ny] != 0:
            return INF

        grid[nx][ny] = 1
        lines += 1
        nx += d_x
        ny += d_y

    return lines


def solve():
    # initialize a grid, 
    # the number of processors (edges) which are placed at the edges,
    # and the ones (positions) which are placed among the grid
    N = int(input())
    grid = []
    positions = []
    edges = 0  # to check the grid is surrounded by cores
    for i in range(N):
        row = list(map(int, input().split()))
        grid.append(row)
        for j in range(N):
            if row[j] != 1:
                continue
            elif 0 < i < N - 1 and 0 < j < N - 1:
                positions.append((i, j))
            else:
                edges += 1

    # return 0 if processors surrounds the grid entirely
    if edges == (N * 2 + (N - 2) * 2):
        return 0

    # return the num of processors which are connected to edges as many as possible  
    for count in range(len(positions), 0, -1):  # check2
        result = INF  # check3
        for spots in combinations(positions, count):  
            result = min(result, dfs(grid, 0, spots))

        if result != INF:
            return result


INF = float("inf") # check4
T = int(input())
for test_case in range(1, T + 1):
    result = solve()
    print("#{} {}".format(test_case, result))

```

### Check points

- Check 1: I create a new grid whenever a processor heads forward one of four directions. And then, I just discard the grid if it does its job.
- Check 2: I start from the lengh of positions  to 1 so as to consider as many processors as possible.
- Check 3: To consider all possible combinations given the length, I put `result` before the for-loop of combinations.
- Check 4: I indicate INF for unavailable values.

## What is the time complexity of this code?

The time complexity of the code can be analyzed as follows:

1. The code uses a recursive depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to iterate through all possible combinations of spots. The number of possible combinations is determined by the length of the `positions` list, denoted as `len(positions)`. In the worst case, the DFS algorithm will explore all possible combinations.

2. Within the DFS algorithm, the `strokeLine` function is called to stroke lines in the grid. The `strokeLine` function iterates through the grid in a straight line until it encounters a non-empty cell or reaches the boundary. The number of cells stroked in a straight line is determined by the size of the grid, denoted as `N`. Therefore, the time complexity of `strokeLine` is O(N).

3. Overall, the time complexity of the DFS algorithm is O(len(positions) * N^2), as it needs to explore all possible combinations and stroking lines can take up to O(N^2) time.

4. Additionally, the code includes a nested loop to iterate through `positions` using the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module. The time complexity of the `combinations` function is O(2^len(positions)), as it generates all possible combinations. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the nested loop is O(len(positions) * 2^len(positions)).

5. The code also includes a loop that iterates from `len(positions)` down to 0. In the worst case, this loop will execute len(positions) times. Therefore, its time complexity is O(len(positions)).

6. Finally, the code includes a loop that iterates T times, where T is the number of test cases. The time complexity of this loop is O(T).

Overall, considering all these factors, the final time complexity of the code can be approximated as O(T * len(positions) * (2^len(positions)) * N^2).

It's important to note that this analysis assumes that other operations, such as list manipulations and comparisons, have constant time complexity compared to the size of the grid or positions.

i.e. 12 * 2^12 * 12^2 == 7,077,888
