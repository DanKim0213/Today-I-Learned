## My solution

```python
from itertools import combinations

dx = [0, 0, -1, 1]
dy = [-1, 1, 0, 0]


def dfs(grid, idx, spots):
    if idx == len(spots):
        # print("----spots----:", spots)
        # for i in range(len(grid)):
        #     print(grid[i])
        return 0

    min_strokes = INF
    for i in range(4):
        new_grid = [row[:] for row in grid] # check 1
        current = strokeLine(new_grid, spots[idx], dx[i], dy[i])
        if current == INF:
            continue
        strokedLines = dfs(new_grid, idx + 1, spots)
        if strokedLines == INF:
            continue
        min_strokes = min(min_strokes, strokedLines + current)
    return min_strokes


def strokeLine(grid, spot, d_x, d_y):
    N = len(grid)
    lines = 0

    x, y = spot
    nx, ny = x + d_x, y + d_y
    while 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N:
        if grid[nx][ny] != 0:
            return INF

        grid[nx][ny] = 1
        lines += 1
        nx += d_x
        ny += d_y

    return lines


def solve():
    # initialize a grid, 
    # the number of processors (edges) which are placed at the edges,
    # and the ones (positions) which are placed among the grid
    N = int(input())
    grid = []
    positions = []
    edges = 0  # to check the grid is surrounded by cores
    for i in range(N):
        row = list(map(int, input().split()))
        grid.append(row)
        for j in range(N):
            if row[j] != 1:
                continue
            elif 0 < i < N - 1 and 0 < j < N - 1:
                positions.append((i, j))
            else:
                edges += 1

    # return 0 if processors surrounds the grid entirely
    if edges == (N * 2 + (N - 2) * 2):
        return 0

    # return the num of processors which are connected to edges as many as possible  
    for count in range(len(positions), 0, -1):  # check2
        result = INF  # check3
        for spots in combinations(positions, count):  
            result = min(result, dfs(grid, 0, spots))

        if result != INF:
            return result


INF = float("inf") # check4
T = int(input())
for test_case in range(1, T + 1):
    result = solve()
    print("#{} {}".format(test_case, result))

```

### Check points

- Check 1: I create a new grid whenever a processor heads forward one of four directions. And then, I just discard the grid if it does its job.
- Check 2: I start from the lengh of positions  to 1 so as to consider as many processors as possible.
- Check 3: To consider all possible combinations given the length, I put `result` before the for-loop of combinations.
- Check 4: I indicate INF for unavailable values.
