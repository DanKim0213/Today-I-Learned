## Could you solve Baekjoon 16928?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 16928 problem is known as "뱀과 사다리 게임" (Snake and Ladder Game). Here's the Python code to solve it using breadth-first search (BFS):

```python
from collections import deque
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline


def snake_and_ladder_game(graph):
    n = 100
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)

    visited[1] = True
    queue = deque([(1, 0)])  # (current position, distance

    while queue:
        current, distance = queue.popleft()

        if current == n:
            return distance

        for next_pos in range(current + 1, current + 7):
            if next_pos <= n:
                if next_pos in graph:
                    next_pos = graph[next_pos]

                if not visited[next_pos]:
                    visited[next_pos] = True
                    queue.append((next_pos, distance + 1))
    return -1


l, s = map(int, input().split())

graph = dict()
for _ in range(l + s):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    graph[a] = b

result = snake_and_ladder_game(graph)
print(result)
```

In this solution, we use breadth-first search (BFS) to find the minimum number of moves required to reach the destination position (cell 100) in the snake and ladder game. Here's how the code works:

- The `snake_and_ladder_game` function takes dictionaries `ladders` and `snakes` as input, representing the positions of ladders and snakes on the board, respectively. It returns the minimum number of moves required to reach the destination position (cell 100).
- We initialize a list `visited` to keep track of visited positions and a list `dist` to store the distance from the start position to each position on the board. Both lists are initialized with default values of `False` and infinity, respectively.
- We mark the start position (cell 1) as visited with a distance of 0.
- We use a queue `queue` to perform the BFS. Each element in the queue is a tuple `(current, distance)`, representing the current position on the board and the distance from the start position.
- In each iteration of the BFS, we pop an element `(current, distance)` from the queue and check if it is the destination position (cell 100). If it is, we return the distance.
- Otherwise, we generate all possible next positions by rolling a 6-sided die. We consider positions from `current + 1` to `current + 6`. If a position is within the board limits, we check if it corresponds to a ladder or a snake. If it does, we update the next position accordingly.
- If the next position has not been visited, we mark it as visited, update its distance, and enqueue it into the queue.
- If the BFS completes without reaching the destination position, it means it is not possible to reach the destination, so we return `-1`.

In the main part of the code:

- We read the input values `l` and `s`, representing the number of ladders and snakes, respectively.
- We iterate `l` times to read the positions of ladders and add them to the `ladders` dictionary.
- We iterate `s` times to read the positions of snakes and add them to the `snakes` dictionary.
- We call the `snake_and_ladder_game` function with the `ladders` and `snakes` dictionaries to calculate the minimum number of moves required to reach the destination position.
- We print the result.

The code assumes the input is read from standard input. The first line contains the values of `l` and `s`. The following `l` lines represent the positions of ladders, and the following `s` lines represent the positions of snakes. Each line contains two integers `a` and `b`, representing a ladder from position `a` to `b`, or a snake from position `c` to `d`. You may need to modify the code if your input format differs.

Please note that this solution assumes there are no overlapping ladders or snakes, and the input is valid according to the problem constraints.

## What I learned

### How do I check if I visit or not

```python
visited = set()
if val not in visited:
    visited.add(val)

```

```python
visited = [False] * N
if not visited[val]:
    visited[val] = True

```
