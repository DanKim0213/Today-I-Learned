## Could you solve Baekjoon 3109?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 3109 problem is called "빵집" (Bakery). The problem involves finding the maximum number of pipelines the baker can build to connect the gas source to the bakery without crossing any obstacles.

Here's the Python solution for the Baekjoon 3109 problem:

```python
import sys

dx = [-1, 0, 1]  # Directions: up, straight, down

def build_pipelines(grid, n, m):
    count = 0

    for i in range(n):
        if dfs(grid, i, 0, n, m):
            count += 1

    return count

def dfs(grid, x, y, n, m):
    if y == m - 1:
        return True

    for direction in dx:
        nx = x + direction
        ny = y + 1

        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and grid[nx][ny] == '.':
            grid[nx][ny] = 'x'
            if dfs(grid, nx, ny, n, m):
                return True

    return False

def main():
    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    grid = []

    for _ in range(n):
        row = list(sys.stdin.readline().rstrip())
        grid.append(row)

    result = build_pipelines(grid, n, m)
    print(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

To use this solution, you can provide the input values through standard input. The first line should contain two integers separated by a space: `n` (the number of rows in the grid) and `m` (the number of columns in the grid). Then, you need to provide `n` lines, each containing `m` characters representing the grid. The character '.' represents an empty space, and the character 'x' represents an obstacle that cannot be crossed.

After running the code, it will output the maximum number of pipelines the baker can build to connect the gas source to the bakery without crossing any obstacles.
