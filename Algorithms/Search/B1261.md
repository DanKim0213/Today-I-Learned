## Could you solve Baekjoon 1261?

Certainly! Baekjoon 1261 is another problem on the Baekjoon Online Judge platform. It involves finding the minimum number of walls that need to be broken to reach the destination in a grid-based maze, where each cell can either be empty (0) or have a wall (1).

Here's the Python code to solve the Baekjoon 1261 problem using Dijkstra's algorithm:

```python
import heapq
import sys

def dijkstra(start, maze):
    # Define directions: up, down, left, right
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

    # Get the number of rows and columns in the maze
    rows = len(maze)
    cols = len(maze[0])

    # Initialize distances with infinity
    distances = [[sys.maxsize] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    distances[start[0]][start[1]] = 0

    # Use min-heap for efficient extraction of the cell with minimum distance
    min_heap = []
    heapq.heappush(min_heap, (0, start))

    while min_heap:
        current_distance, current_cell = heapq.heappop(min_heap)

        # Skip if already visited with a shorter distance
        if current_distance > distances[current_cell[0]][current_cell[1]]:
            continue

        for direction in directions:
            new_row = current_cell[0] + direction[0]
            new_col = current_cell[1] + direction[1]

            # Check if the new cell is within the maze bounds
            if 0 <= new_row < rows and 0 <= new_col < cols:
                distance = current_distance + maze[new_row][new_col]

                # Relaxation: Update the distance if a shorter path is found
                if distance < distances[new_row][new_col]:
                    distances[new_row][new_col] = distance
                    heapq.heappush(min_heap, (distance, (new_row, new_col)))

    return distances

# Main function to solve the problem
def solve():
    M, N = map(int, input().split())  # Read the number of columns (M) and rows (N)
    maze = []

    for _ in range(N):
        maze.append(list(map(int, input().strip())))

    start = (0, 0)  # Start position
    distances = dijkstra(start, maze)
    min_distance = distances[N-1][M-1]  # Minimum distance to the destination

    print(min_distance)

solve()
```

Make sure to provide the input for the problem as specified on the Baekjoon Online Judge platform. The code will output the minimum number of walls that need to be broken to reach the destination (bottom-right cell) from the start position (top-left cell) in the maze.

Note that this code assumes that the input is valid and follows the problem's constraints. It also assumes that the number of columns (M), number of rows (N), and the maze grid with walls (1) and empty cells (0) are provided via standard input (console).
