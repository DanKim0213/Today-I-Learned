## Solution

```python

def solution(n, times):
    min_time = min(times)
    start, end = min_time, min_time * n
    answer = 0

    while start <= end:
        mid = (start + end) // 2

        total = 0
        for time in times:
            total += mid // time

        if total >= n:
            answer = mid
            end = mid - 1
        else:
            start = mid + 1

    return answer
```
