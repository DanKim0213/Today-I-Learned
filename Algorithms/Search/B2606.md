## Could you solve Baekjoon B2606?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 2606 problem is a simple graph traversal problem that involves finding the number of computers connected to a given computer in a network. Here's a Python solution for the problem using Depth-First Search (DFS):

```python
def dfs(graph, start, visited):
    visited.add(start)

    for neighbor in graph[start]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)


def solution():
    n = int(input())  # Number of computers
    m = int(input())  # Number of edges

    graph = {i: [] for i in range(1, n+1)}  # Create an empty graph

    # Build the graph by adding edges
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)

    visited = set()
    dfs(graph, 1, visited)  # Start DFS traversal from computer 1

    # The number of computers visited (excluding computer 1)
    count = len(visited) - 1
    print(count)


solution()
```

In this solution, we represent the network as an undirected graph using a dictionary-based adjacency list. Each computer is a key in the dictionary, and its value is a list of neighboring computers.

The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search traversal of the graph starting from a given computer. It uses a set, `visited`, to keep track of visited computers. It recursively visits all connected computers and adds them to the `visited` set.

The `solution` function reads input from the user, builds the graph based on the input, and then calls the `dfs` function to traverse the graph starting from computer 1. Finally, it calculates the number of visited computers (excluding computer 1) and prints the result.

Please note that this solution assumes the input is given through standard input (stdin) and the output is printed to standard output (stdout) as per the requirements of the Baekjoon 2606 problem. You can modify the code accordingly if you prefer a different input/output method.
