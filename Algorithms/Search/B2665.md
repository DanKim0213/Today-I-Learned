## Could you solve Baekjoon 2665?

Certainly! Baekjoon 2665 is another problem on the Baekjoon Online Judge platform. It involves finding the minimum number of changes needed to convert a given maze with black and white cells into a maze where all cells are white, using the following rules: 
- You can change a black cell to a white cell.
- You can move to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) that are also white cells.

Here's the Python code to solve the Baekjoon 2665 problem using Dijkstra's algorithm:

```python
import heapq
import sys

def dijkstra(start, maze):
    # Define directions: up, down, left, right
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

    # Get the number of rows and columns in the maze
    rows = len(maze)
    cols = len(maze[0])

    # Initialize distances with infinity
    distances = [[sys.maxsize] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    distances[start[0]][start[1]] = 0

    # Use min-heap for efficient extraction of the cell with minimum distance
    min_heap = []
    heapq.heappush(min_heap, (0, start))

    while min_heap:
        current_distance, current_cell = heapq.heappop(min_heap)

        # Skip if already visited with a shorter distance
        if current_distance > distances[current_cell[0]][current_cell[1]]:
            continue

        for direction in directions:
            new_row = current_cell[0] + direction[0]
            new_col = current_cell[1] + direction[1]

            # Check if the new cell is within the maze bounds
            if 0 <= new_row < rows and 0 <= new_col < cols:
                distance = current_distance + (0 if maze[new_row][new_col] == '1' else 1)

                # Relaxation: Update the distance if a shorter path is found
                if distance < distances[new_row][new_col]:
                    distances[new_row][new_col] = distance
                    heapq.heappush(min_heap, (distance, (new_row, new_col)))

    return distances

# Main function to solve the problem
def solve():
    N = int(input())  # Read the size of the maze
    maze = []

    for _ in range(N):
        maze.append(input().strip())

    start = (0, 0)  # Start position
    distances = dijkstra(start, maze)
    min_changes = distances[N-1][N-1]  # Minimum number of changes needed

    print(min_changes)

solve()
```

Make sure to provide the input for the problem as specified on the Baekjoon Online Judge platform. The code will output the minimum number of changes needed to convert the maze from the start position (top-left cell) to the destination (bottom-right cell) where all cells are white.

Note that this code assumes that the input is valid and follows the problem's constraints. It also assumes that the size of the maze (N) and the maze grid with black cells ('1') and white cells ('0') are provided via standard input (console).
