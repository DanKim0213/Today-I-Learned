## Could you solve Baekjoon 1697?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 1697 problem is a simple graph traversal problem that involves finding the minimum number of moves to reach a target location from a given starting location. Here's a Python solution for the problem using Breadth-First Search (BFS):

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(start, target):
    if start == target:
        return 0

    visited = [False] * 100001
    visited[start] = True
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (location, time)

    while queue:
        location, time = queue.popleft()

        for next_loc in (location - 1, location + 1, location * 2):
            if 0 <= next_loc <= 100000 and not visited[next_loc]:
                if next_loc == target:
                    return time + 1

                visited[next_loc] = True
                queue.append((next_loc, time + 1))

    return -1


def solution():
    start, target = map(int, input().split())
    result = bfs(start, target)
    print(result)


solution()
```

In this solution, the `bfs` function performs a breadth-first search traversal to find the minimum number of moves required to reach the target location from the start location. It uses a queue to keep track of the locations and their corresponding time (number of moves) taken to reach them.

The function iteratively visits neighboring locations and checks if they are within the range of 0 to 100,000 and have not been visited before. If a neighbor location matches the target, the function returns the time taken to reach it. Otherwise, it marks the neighbor location as visited, adds it to the queue with an updated time, and continues the traversal.

The `solution` function reads input from the user, initializes the start and target locations, and calls the `bfs` function to find the minimum number of moves. Finally, it prints the result.

Please note that this solution assumes the input is given through standard input (stdin) and the output is printed to standard output (stdout) as per the requirements of the Baekjoon 1697 problem. You can modify the code accordingly if you prefer a different input/output method.
