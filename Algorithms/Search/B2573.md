## Could you solve Baekjoon 2573?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 2573 problem is commonly known as the "Iceberg" problem. It can be solved using a combination of Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms. Here's a Python implementation for the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(start, graph, visited):
    queue = deque([start])
    visited[start[0]][start[1]] = True

    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()

        for dx, dy in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy

            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and not visited[nx][ny]:
                if graph[nx][ny] > 0:
                    visited[nx][ny] = True
                    queue.append((nx, ny))

def dfs(x, y, graph, visited):
    visited[x][y] = True

    for dx, dy in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy

        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and not visited[nx][ny] and graph[nx][ny] > 0:
            dfs(nx, ny, graph, visited)

def count_icebergs(graph, visited):
    count = 0

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if graph[i][j] > 0 and not visited[i][j]:
                dfs(i, j, graph, visited)
                count += 1

    return count

def simulate_melting(graph):
    new_graph = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if graph[i][j] > 0:
                count = 0

                for dx, dy in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
                    nx, ny = i + dx, j + dy

                    if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and graph[nx][ny] == 0:
                        count += 1

                new_graph[i][j] = max(graph[i][j] - count, 0)

    return new_graph

n, m = map(int, input().split())  # Size of the iceberg map
graph = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]  # Initial iceberg map

year = 0
while True:
    visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
    iceberg_count = count_icebergs(graph, visited)

    if iceberg_count >= 2:
        print(year)
        break

    if iceberg_count == 0:
        print(0)
        break

    graph = simulate_melting(graph)
    year += 1
```

In this code, we first define a `bfs` function that performs the breadth-first search. It takes the starting point, the iceberg map (`graph`), and a visited matrix as input. The function uses a deque (`queue`) to store the nodes to be visited and a visited matrix to keep track of visited nodes.

Inside the `bfs` function, we start by adding the starting point to the queue and marking it as visited. We continue the BFS until the queue is empty. For each node in the queue, we iterate over

 its neighboring cells in the up, down, left, and right directions. If a neighboring cell is within the bounds of the iceberg map and has not been visited, we check if it contains a nonzero value (representing an iceberg). If it does, we mark it as visited and add it to the queue.

Next, we define a `dfs` function that performs the depth-first search. It takes the current coordinates, the iceberg map (`graph`), and a visited matrix as input. The function recursively explores the neighboring cells of the current cell in the up, down, left, and right directions. If a neighboring cell is within the bounds of the iceberg map, has not been visited, and contains a nonzero value, we mark it as visited and recursively call the `dfs` function on it.

The `count_icebergs` function calculates the number of separate iceberg components in the iceberg map. It iterates over all cells in the iceberg map and uses the `dfs` function to explore each iceberg component. If an unvisited cell with a nonzero value is encountered, it means a new iceberg component has been found, and the `dfs` function is called on it. The function returns the total count of iceberg components.

The `simulate_melting` function simulates the melting process of the icebergs. It creates a new graph to store the updated iceberg map after melting. It iterates over all cells in the original iceberg map and checks the neighboring cells in the up, down, left, and right directions. For each cell, it counts the number of neighboring cells that are outside the iceberg (zero value). It then calculates the new iceberg value by subtracting the count of neighboring zero cells from the current cell value. If the new value is negative, it is set to zero. The updated iceberg map is returned.

In the main part of the code, we read the input, including the size of the iceberg map (`n` and `m`) and the initial state of the iceberg map. We start a loop to simulate the melting process. Inside the loop, we create a visited matrix and count the number of iceberg components using the `count_icebergs` function. If there are two or more iceberg components, we print the number of years (`year`) and break out of the loop. If there are no iceberg components left, we print 0 and break out of the loop. Otherwise, we simulate the melting process by updating the iceberg map using the `simulate_melting` function and increment the year counter.
