## Could you solve Baekjoon 2109?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 2109 problem is called "순회강연" (Lecture). The problem involves scheduling lectures to maximize the total payment while ensuring that each lecture is given only once.

Here's the Python solution for the Baekjoon 2109 problem:

```python
import sys
import heapq


def schedule_lectures(lectures):
    lectures.sort(
        key=lambda x: x[1]
    )  # Sort the lectures by the deadline in ascending order
    min_heap = []  # Use a min heap to keep track of the highest payments
    total_payment = 0

    for lecture in lectures:
        heapq.heappush(
            min_heap, lecture[0]
        )  # Push the payment of the current lecture into the min heap

        if (
            len(min_heap) > lecture[1]
        ):  # If the min heap exceeds the current deadline, remove the lecture with the lowest payment
            heapq.heappop(min_heap)

    total_payment = sum(min_heap)  # Calculate the total payment

    return total_payment


def main():
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    lectures = []

    for _ in range(n):
        payment, deadline = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        lectures.append((payment, deadline))

    result = schedule_lectures(lectures)
    print(result)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To use this solution, you can provide the input values through standard input. The first line should contain an integer `n` representing the number of lectures. Then, you need to provide `n` lines, each containing two integers separated by a space: the payment of the lecture and its deadline.

After running the code, it will output the maximum total payment that can be obtained by scheduling the lectures according to the given rules.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance!

## My solution

```python
def schedule_lectures(lectures):
    search_idx = dict()
    vals = [0] * 10001
    lectures.sort(key=lambda x: -x[0])  # Sort by descending order of payment

    for lecture in lectures:
        payment, deadline = lecture

        idx = search_idx.setdefault(deadline, deadline)
        while vals[idx] > 0 and idx > 0:
            idx -= 1

        if idx == 0:
            continue

        search_idx[deadline] = idx
        vals[idx] = payment

    return sum(vals[1:])


def main():
    n = int(input())
    lectures = []

    for _ in range(n):
        payment, deadline = map(int, input().split())
        lectures.append((payment, deadline))

    result = schedule_lectures(lectures)
    print(result)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```
