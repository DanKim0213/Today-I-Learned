## Could you solve B2178?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 2178 problem is a graph traversal problem that involves finding the shortest path in a maze. Here's a Python solution using Breadth-First Search (BFS):

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(maze, start):
    n = len(maze)
    m = len(maze[0])

    # Define directions: up, down, left, right
    dx = [-1, 1, 0, 0]
    dy = [0, 0, -1, 1]

    queue = deque()
    queue.append(start)
    visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
    visited[start[0]][start[1]] = True
    dist = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]

    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()

        for i in range(4):
            nx = x + dx[i]
            ny = y + dy[i]

            if nx < 0 or nx >= n or ny < 0 or ny >= m:
                continue

            if maze[nx][ny] == 0 or visited[nx][ny]:
                continue

            dist[nx][ny] = dist[x][y] + 1
            visited[nx][ny] = True
            queue.append((nx, ny))

    return dist[n-1][m-1]


def solution():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    maze = []

    for _ in range(n):
        row = list(map(int, input()))
        maze.append(row)

    result = bfs(maze, (0, 0)) + 1
    print(result)


solution()
```

In this solution, the `bfs` function performs a breadth-first search traversal of the maze to find the shortest path. It uses a queue to keep track of the cells to visit. It starts from the `(0, 0)` cell and iteratively explores its neighboring cells until it reaches the destination `(n-1, m-1)` or exhausts all possible paths.

The function maintains a `visited` matrix to mark the cells that have been visited to avoid revisiting them. It also maintains a `dist` matrix to store the minimum distance from the start cell to each cell in the maze.

The `solution` function reads input from the user, initializes the maze, and calls the `bfs` function to find the shortest path. Finally, it prints the result.

Please note that this solution assumes the input is given through standard input (stdin) and the output is printed to standard output (stdout) as per the requirements of the Baekjoon 2178 problem. You can modify the code accordingly if you prefer a different input/output method.
