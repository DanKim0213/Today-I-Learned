## Could you solve Baekjoon 1753?

Certainly! Baekjoon 1753 is another problem on the Baekjoon Online Judge platform. It involves finding the shortest path from a given starting vertex to all other vertices in a weighted directed graph using Dijkstra's algorithm.

Here's the Python code to solve the Baekjoon 1753 problem:

```python
import heapq
import sys

def dijkstra(start, graph):
    # Initialize distances with infinity
    distances = {vertex: sys.maxsize for vertex in graph}
    distances[start] = 0

    # Use min-heap for efficient extraction of the vertex with minimum distance
    min_heap = []
    heapq.heappush(min_heap, (0, start))

    while min_heap:
        current_distance, current_vertex = heapq.heappop(min_heap)

        # Skip if already visited with a shorter distance
        if current_distance > distances[current_vertex]:
            continue

        for adjacent_vertex, weight in graph[current_vertex]:
            distance = current_distance + weight

            # Relaxation: Update the distance if a shorter path is found
            if distance < distances[adjacent_vertex]:
                distances[adjacent_vertex] = distance
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, (distance, adjacent_vertex))

    return distances

# Main function to solve the problem
def solve():
    V, E = map(int, input().split())  # Read the number of vertices (V) and edges (E)
    start_vertex = int(input())  # Read the starting vertex
    graph = {vertex: [] for vertex in range(1, V + 1)}

    for _ in range(E):
        u, v, w = map(int, input().split())  # Read an edge (u, v) with weight w
        graph[u].append((v, w))

    distances = dijkstra(start_vertex, graph)

    # Output the shortest distances to all vertices
    for vertex in range(1, V + 1):
        if distances[vertex] == sys.maxsize:
            print("INF")
        else:
            print(distances[vertex])

solve()
```

Make sure to provide the input for the problem as specified on the Baekjoon Online Judge platform. The code will output the shortest distances from the given starting vertex to all other vertices in the graph.

Note that this code assumes that the input is valid and follows the problem's constraints. It also assumes that the number of vertices, number of edges, starting vertex, and the graph's edges with weights are provided via standard input (console).
