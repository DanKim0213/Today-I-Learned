## Could you solve Baekjoon 4485?

Certainly! Baekjoon 4485 is another problem on the Baekjoon Online Judge platform. It involves finding the minimum amount of gold required to reach the destination from the starting point in a grid-based maze, where each cell has a certain amount of gold and moving from one cell to another incurs a cost equal to the gold in the destination cell.

Here's the Python code to solve the Baekjoon 4485 problem using Dijkstra's algorithm:

```python
import heapq
import sys

def dijkstra(start, maze):
    # Define directions: up, down, left, right
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

    # Get the number of rows and columns in the maze
    rows = len(maze)
    cols = len(maze[0])

    # Initialize distances with infinity
    distances = [[sys.maxsize] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    distances[start[0]][start[1]] = maze[start[0]][start[1]]

    # Use min-heap for efficient extraction of the cell with minimum distance
    min_heap = []
    heapq.heappush(min_heap, (maze[start[0]][start[1]], start))

    while min_heap:
        current_distance, current_cell = heapq.heappop(min_heap)

        # Skip if already visited with a shorter distance
        if current_distance > distances[current_cell[0]][current_cell[1]]:
            continue

        for direction in directions:
            new_row = current_cell[0] + direction[0]
            new_col = current_cell[1] + direction[1]

            # Check if the new cell is within the maze bounds
            if 0 <= new_row < rows and 0 <= new_col < cols:
                distance = current_distance + maze[new_row][new_col]

                # Relaxation: Update the distance if a shorter path is found
                if distance < distances[new_row][new_col]:
                    distances[new_row][new_col] = distance
                    heapq.heappush(min_heap, (distance, (new_row, new_col)))

    return distances

# Main function to solve the problem
def solve():
    INF = sys.maxsize  # Infinity value
    test_case = 1

    while True:
        N = int(input())  # Read the size of the maze

        if N == 0:
            break

        maze = []
        for _ in range(N):
            maze.append(list(map(int, input().split())))

        start = (0, 0)  # Start position
        distances = dijkstra(start, maze)
        min_gold = distances[N-1][N-1]  # Minimum gold required to reach the destination

        print("Problem {}: {}".format(test_case, min_gold))
        test_case += 1

solve()
```

Make sure to provide the input for the problem as specified on the Baekjoon Online Judge platform. The code will output the minimum amount of gold required to reach the destination (bottom-right cell) from the start position (top-left cell) in each test case.

Note that this code assumes that the input is valid and follows the problem's constraints. It also assumes that the size of the maze (N) and the maze grid with the amount of gold in each cell are provided via standard input (console).
