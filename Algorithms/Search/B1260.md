그래프를 DFS로 탐색한 결과와 BFS로 탐색한 결과를 출력하는 프로그램을 작성하시오. 단, 방문할 수 있는 정점이 여러 개인 경우에는 정점 번호가 작은 것을 먼저 방문하고, 더 이상 방문할 수 있는 점이 없는 경우 종료한다. 정점 번호는 1번부터 N번까지이다.

## Could you solve Baekjoon 1260 in python?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 1260 problem is a graph traversal problem that involves implementing Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms. Here's a Python solution for the problem:

```python
from collections import defaultdict


def dfs(graph, start):
    visited = []
    stack = [start]

    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        if node not in visited:
            visited.append(node)
            stack.extend(sorted(graph[node], reverse=True))

    return visited


def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = []
    queue = [start]

    while queue:
        node = queue.pop(0)
        if node not in visited:
            visited.append(node)
            queue.extend(sorted(graph[node]))

    return visited


def solution():
    n, m, v = map(int, input().split())
    graph = defaultdict(list)

    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)

    dfs_result = dfs(graph, v)
    bfs_result = bfs(graph, v)

    print(' '.join(str(node) for node in dfs_result))
    print(' '.join(str(node) for node in bfs_result))


solution()
```

In this solution, we use a dictionary-based graph representation using `defaultdict` from the `collections` module. Each node is a key in the dictionary, and its corresponding value is a list of adjacent nodes.

The `dfs` function performs Depth-First Search starting from a given node. It uses a stack to keep track of nodes to visit. The algorithm visits nodes in a depth-first manner, marking each visited node and adding its unvisited neighbors to the stack.

The `bfs` function performs Breadth-First Search starting from a given node. It uses a queue to keep track of nodes to visit. The algorithm visits nodes in a breadth-first manner, marking each visited node and adding its unvisited neighbors to the queue.

The `solution` function reads input from the user, initializes the graph using the dictionary representation, and calls the `dfs` and `bfs` functions to get the traversal results. Finally, it prints the nodes visited in the DFS and BFS order.

Please note that this solution assumes the input is given through standard input (stdin) and the output is printed to standard output (stdout) as per the requirements of the Baekjoon 1260 problem. You can modify the code accordingly if you prefer a different input/output method.
