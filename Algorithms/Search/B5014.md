## Could you solve Baekjoon 5014?

Certainly! Baekjoon 5014 is a problem about finding the minimum number of button presses required to reach a target floor in a building using an elevator. Here's the solution:

Problem Statement:
You are in a building with F floors and are currently on floor S. There are two buttons in the elevator: "U" (up) and "D" (down). Pressing the "U" button takes you up one floor, and pressing the "D" button takes you down one floor.

You need to reach the target floor G using the elevator, starting from floor S. However, there are some floors that are under construction and cannot be visited.

You are given the number of floors F, the current floor S, the target floor G, the number of up buttons U, the number of down buttons D, and a list of floors that are under construction. Your task is to find the minimum number of button presses required to reach the target floor G, or determine that it is impossible to reach the target floor.

Solution:
To solve this problem, we can use a modified breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. We can treat each floor as a node in a graph, and the buttons "U" and "D" as edges connecting the nodes.

Here's the step-by-step algorithm:

1. Initialize a queue and a visited array. Mark the current floor S as visited.
2. Enqueue the current floor S into the queue, along with a counter initialized to 0 (to keep track of the number of button presses).
3. While the queue is not empty:
   - Dequeue a floor and the button press counter from the front of the queue.
   - If the dequeued floor is the target floor G, return the button press counter.
   - Otherwise, consider pressing the "U" button and calculate the next floor. If the next floor is valid (within the building limits and not under construction) and not visited, mark it as visited, increment the button press counter by 1, and enqueue it into the queue.
   - Repeat the above step for the "D" button.
4. If the queue becomes empty and the target floor is not reached, return the string "use the stairs" (indicating that it is impossible to reach the target floor).

Here's the Python code implementing the above algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_minimum_button_presses(F, S, G, U, D, construction):
    queue = deque()
    visited = [False] * (F + 1)
    visited[S] = True
    queue.append((S, 0))

    while queue:
        floor, presses = queue.popleft()

        if floor == G:
            return presses

        next_floor_u = floor + U
        next_floor_d = floor - D

        if next_floor_u <= F and next_floor_u not in construction and not visited[next_floor_u]:
            visited[next_floor_u] = True
            queue.append((next_floor_u, presses + 1))

        if next_floor_d >= 1 and next_floor_d not in construction and not visited[next_floor_d]:
            visited[next_floor_d] = True
            queue.append((next_floor_d, presses + 1))

    return "use the stairs"

# Example usage:
F, S, G, U, D = map(int, input().split())
construction = set()

result = find_minimum_button_presses(F, S, G, U, D, construction)
print(result)
```

You can input the values for F, S, G, U, D, and the list of construction floors when prompted, and the program will output the minimum number of button presses required to reach
