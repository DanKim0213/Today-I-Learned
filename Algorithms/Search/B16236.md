Q. How many fishes can the baby shark eat?

- The size of the area is NxN.
- A fish could be in a room or not. 
- The baby shark starts from the size of 2 and it can moves four directions to adjacent rooms.
- However, it can go through the same size of it while it cannot eat the fish.
- The baby shark cannot go through a room where a bigger fish than it stays.
- The decision making logic is:
    - 더 이상 먹을 수 있는 물고기가 공간에 없다면 아기 상어는 엄마 상어에게 도움을 요청한다.
    - 먹을 수 있는 물고기가 1마리라면, 그 물고기를 먹으러 간다.
    - 먹을 수 있는 물고기가 1마리보다 많다면, 거리가 가장 가까운 물고기를 먹으러 간다.
        - 거리는 아기 상어가 있는 칸에서 물고기가 있는 칸으로 이동할 때, 지나야하는 칸의 개수의 최솟값이다.
        - 거리가 가까운 물고기가 많다면, 가장 위에 있는 물고기, 그러한 물고기가 여러마리라면, 가장 왼쪽에 있는 물고기를 먹는다.
- It takes 1 sec to move and eating doesn't take time.
- Whenver it eats a fish, it grows 1 bigger.

## Could you solve Baekjoon 16236 in python?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 16236 problem, also known as "Shark" or "아기 상어" in Korean, is a popular algorithmic problem. It involves simulating the movement of a shark in a 2D grid and determining the time it takes for the shark to eat all the prey. Here's a Python solution for the problem:

```python
from collections import deque


def bfs(x, y, size):
    n = len(graph)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    queue = deque([(x, y, 0)])
    candidates = []

    while queue:
        x, y, dist = queue.popleft()
        visited[x][y] = True

        for i in range(4):
            nx = x + dx[i]
            ny = y + dy[i]

            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and not visited[nx][ny]:
                if graph[nx][ny] <= size:
                    visited[nx][ny] = True
                    queue.append((nx, ny, dist + 1))
                    if 0 < graph[nx][ny] < size:
                        candidates.append((nx, ny, dist + 1))

    candidates.sort(
        key=lambda x: (x[2], x[0], x[1])
    )  # Sort by distance, x, and y coordinates
    return candidates[0] if candidates else None


def solution():
    shark_size = 2
    eaten = 0
    time = 0

    for i in range(n):
        row = list(map(int, input().split()))
        graph.append(row)
        for j in range(n):
            if row[j] == 9:
                shark_x, shark_y = i, j
                graph[i][j] = 0

    while True:
        result = bfs(shark_x, shark_y, shark_size)
        if result is None:
            break

        x, y, dist = result
        graph[x][y] = 0
        shark_x, shark_y = x, y
        eaten += 1
        time += dist

        if eaten >= shark_size:
            shark_size += 1
            eaten = 0

    return time


n = int(input())
graph = []
dx = [-1, 0, 0, 1]
dy = [0, -1, 1, 0]

print(solution())
```

In this solution, the `bfs` function performs a breadth-first search to find the nearest prey that the shark can eat. It keeps track of the distance from the starting point and stores the candidate preys in a list. The function returns the prey with the smallest distance if there are any candidates.

The `solution` function takes input from the user and initializes the variables. It then repeatedly calls the `bfs` function to find the nearest prey, updates the shark's position, and checks if the shark has grown in size due to eating enough prey. The loop continues until there are no more candidate preys.

Finally, the `solution` function returns the total time it took for the shark to eat all the prey.

Please note that this solution assumes the input is given through standard input (stdin) and the output is printed to standard output (stdout) as per the requirements of the Baekjoon 16236 problem. You can modify the code accordingly if you prefer a different input/output method.
