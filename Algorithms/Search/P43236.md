## Solution

```python
def solution(distance, rocks, n):
    answer = 0
    start = 0
    end = distance

    rocks.sort()
    rocks.append(distance) # To be honest, distance is not considered as a removable rock
    while start <= end:
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        stones_deleted = 0
        previous_stone = 0

        for rock in rocks:
            if rock - previous_stone < mid:
                stones_deleted += 1
            else:
                previous_stone = rock

        if stones_deleted > n:
            end = mid - 1
        else:
            answer = mid
            start = mid + 1

    return answer


print(solution(1, [1], 1))

```

## What I learned

- Let's make some test cases for testing the rock on the distance
    - since it is not considered as a removable rock
- Why do we choose Binary Search?
- Why is for-loop within while-loop valid?
