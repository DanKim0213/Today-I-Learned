## Solution

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from itertools import combinations
from bisect import bisect_left


def solution(info, query):
    answer = []
    people = defaultdict(list)
    
    # 1. process data to search for scores
    for i in info:
        person = i.split()
        score = int(person.pop())

        for j in range(5):
            candi = list(combinations(person, j))
            for c in candi:
                people["".join(c)].append(score)

    for i in people:
        people[i].sort()

    # 2. binary search for score using bisect_left 
    # so as to get the number of people who are above the score 
    for i in query:
        key = i.split()
        score = int(key.pop())
        key = "".join(key)
        key = key.replace("and", "").replace(" ", "").replace("-", "")
        answer.append(len(people[key]) - bisect_left(people[key], score)) # **

    return answer


info = [
    "java backend junior pizza 150",
    "python frontend senior chicken 210",
    "python frontend senior chicken 150",
    "cpp backend senior pizza 260",
    "java backend junior chicken 80",
    "python backend senior chicken 50",
]

query = [
    "java and backend and junior and pizza 100",
    "python and frontend and senior and chicken 200",
    "cpp and - and senior and pizza 250",
    "- and backend and senior and - 150",
    "- and - and - and chicken 100",
    "- and - and - and - 150",
]

result = [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4]

solution(info, query)

```

## What I learned

- from bisect import bisect\_left
- Binary search can be used to search for right below target using bisect\_left
