## I'd like to know the time complexity of this code

(The number of combinations of 3 among 15 cols is 10, 3 archers, 10 distance * 15 rows * 15 cols, and repeat 15 rows == 10 * 3 * (10 * 15 * 15) * 15. i.e. One million)

The time complexity of the given code can be analyzed as follows:

1. Generating Archer Positions: The code generates all possible combinations of archer positions using the `itertools.combinations()` function. Since there are `m` columns and we choose 3 positions, the number of possible combinations is O(mC3). Therefore, the time complexity of this step is O(mC3) or O(m^3).

2. Main Loop: The main loop iterates over each combination of archer positions. In the worst case, there can be O(mC3) iterations.

3. Enemy Search: The `search_enemy()` function is called for each archer position to find the nearest enemy within the attack range. The search is performed within a fixed range of cells around each archer, which takes O(d * m * n) time.

4. Attack Enemies: The `attack_enemies()` function checks the board for enemies to attack based on the positions of the archers. The number of archers is constant (3 in this case), so the time complexity of this step is O(1).

5. Move Enemies: The `move_enemies()` function moves the enemies closer to the castle. It iterates over the rows of the board (n) and performs a constant-time operation for each row. Therefore, the time complexity of this step is O(n).

Overall, the time complexity of the code can be approximated as O(m^3 * d * m * n).
