## Could you solve Baekjoon 11501?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 11501 problem involves calculating the maximum profit that can be obtained from a given set of stock prices. Here's a Python solution for the problem:

```python
def calculate_max_profit(prices):
    n = len(prices)
    max_profit = 0
    max_price = 0

    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        if prices[i] > max_price:
            max_price = prices[i]
        else:
            max_profit += max_price - prices[i]

    return max_profit


def solution():
    t = int(input())

    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        max_profit = calculate_max_profit(prices)
        print(max_profit)


solution()
```

In this solution, the `calculate_max_profit` function takes a list of stock prices as input and calculates the maximum profit that can be obtained. It iterates over the prices in reverse order and keeps track of the maximum price encountered so far. If the current price is less than the maximum price, it means a profit can be obtained by buying at the current price and selling at the maximum price. The function accumulates the profit and returns the final result.

The `solution` function reads the number of test cases `t` from the user. For each test case, it reads the number of days `n` and the corresponding stock prices. It then calls the `calculate_max_profit` function to calculate the maximum profit for each test case and prints the result.

Please note that this solution assumes the input is given through standard input (stdin) and the output is printed to standard output (stdout) as per the requirements of the Baekjoon 11501 problem. You can modify the code accordingly if you prefer a different input/output method.
