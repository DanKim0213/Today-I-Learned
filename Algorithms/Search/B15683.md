## Could you solve Baekjoon 15683?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 15683 problem is called "감시" (Surveillance). The problem involves finding the minimum number of CCTV cameras needed to monitor a given area effectively.

Here's the Python solution for the Baekjoon 15683 problem:

```python
import sys

# Directions: up, right, down, left
dx = [-1, 0, 1, 0]
dy = [0, 1, 0, -1]

def count_blind_spot(office, cctv_list, idx, n, m):
    if idx == len(cctv_list):
        return calculate_blind_spot(office, n, m)

    x, y, cctv_type = cctv_list[idx]
    result = float('inf')

    for direction in range(4):
        new_office = [row[:] for row in office]
        if cctv_type == 1:
            update_office(new_office, x, y, direction, n, m)
            result = min(result, count_blind_spot(new_office, cctv_list, idx + 1, n, m))
        elif cctv_type == 2:
            update_office(new_office, x, y, direction, n, m)
            update_office(new_office, x, y, (direction + 2) % 4, n, m)
            result = min(result, count_blind_spot(new_office, cctv_list, idx + 1, n, m))
        elif cctv_type == 3:
            update_office(new_office, x, y, direction, n, m)
            update_office(new_office, x, y, (direction + 1) % 4, n, m)
            result = min(result, count_blind_spot(new_office, cctv_list, idx + 1, n, m))
        elif cctv_type == 4:
            update_office(new_office, x, y, direction, n, m)
            update_office(new_office, x, y, (direction + 1) % 4, n, m)
            update_office(new_office, x, y, (direction + 2) % 4, n, m)
            result = min(result, count_blind_spot(new_office, cctv_list, idx + 1, n, m))
        elif cctv_type == 5:
            update_office(new_office, x, y, direction, n, m)
            update_office(new_office, x, y, (direction + 1) % 4, n, m)
            update_office(new_office, x, y, (direction + 2) % 4, n, m)
            update_office(new_office, x, y, (direction + 3) % 4, n, m)
            result = min(result, count_blind_spot(new_office, cctv_list, idx + 1, n, m))

    return result

def update_office(office, x, y, direction, n, m):
    nx = x + dx[direction]
    ny = y + dy[direction]

    while 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m:
        if office[nx][ny] == 6:
            break
        elif office[nx][ny] == 0:
            office[nx][ny] = -1

        nx += dx[direction]
        ny += dy[direction]

def calculate_blind_spot(office, n, m):
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if office[i][j] == 0

:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    office = []
    cctv_list = []

    for i in range(n):
        row = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        office.append(row)
        for j in range(m):
            if row[j] != 0 and row[j] != 6:
                cctv_list.append((i, j, row[j]))

    result = count_blind_spot(office, cctv_list, 0, n, m)
    print(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

To use this solution, you can provide the input values through standard input. The first line should contain two integers separated by a space: `n` (the number of rows in the office) and `m` (the number of columns in the office). Then, you need to provide `n` lines, each containing `m` integers representing the layout of the office. The numbers 0 to 5 represent empty spaces or walls, and the number 6 represents a wall that cannot be monitored by a CCTV.

After running the code, it will output the minimum number of CCTV cameras needed to monitor the office effectively.
