## Could you solve Baekjoon 2468?

Sure! The problem "Baekjoon 2468" refers to a problem on the Baekjoon Online Judge platform (www.acmicpc.net). The problem is about finding the maximum number of safe zones in a given map with varying heights.

Here's a Python implementation that solves Baekjoon 2468:

```python
def dfs(graph, x, y, visited, height):
    dx = [-1, 1, 0, 0]
    dy = [0, 0, -1, 1]
    n = len(graph)

    visited[x][y] = True

    for i in range(4):
        nx = x + dx[i]
        ny = y + dy[i]

        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and not visited[nx][ny] and graph[nx][ny] > height:
            dfs(graph, nx, ny, visited, height)


def get_safe_zones(graph, height):
    n = len(graph)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    safe_zones = 0

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if not visited[i][j] and graph[i][j] > height:
                dfs(graph, i, j, visited, height)
                safe_zones += 1

    return safe_zones


def solution():
    n = int(input())
    graph = []

    for _ in range(n):
        row = list(map(int, input().split()))
        graph.append(row)

    max_safe_zones = 1  # At least one safe zone with the lowest height

    for height in range(1, max(map(max, graph)) + 1):
        max_safe_zones = max(max_safe_zones, get_safe_zones(graph, height))

    print(max_safe_zones)


solution()
```

To use this code, you can input the size of the map (n) followed by n lines, each containing n integers representing the heights of the areas on the map. The program will then output the maximum number of safe zones when the water level rises.
