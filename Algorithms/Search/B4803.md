A graph consists of a set of vertices and edges between pairs of vertices. Two vertices are connected if there is a path (subset of edges) leading from one vertex to another, and a connected component is a maximal subset of vertices that are all connected to each other. A graph consists of one or more connected components.
A tree is a connected component without cycles, but it can also be characterized in other ways. For example, a tree consisting of n vertices has exactly n − 1 edges. Also, there is a unique path connecting any pair of vertices in a tree.
Given a graph, report the number of connected components that are also trees.

Input:
The input consists of a number of cases. Each case starts with two non-negative integers n and m, satisfying n ≤ 500 and m ≤ n(n − 1)/2. This is followed by m lines, each containing two integers specifying the two distinct vertices connected by an edge. No edge will be specified twice (or given again in a different order). The vertices are labelled 1 to n. The end of input is indicated by a line containing n = m =0.

Output:
For each case, print one of the following lines depending on how many different connected components are trees (T > 1 below):
Case x: A forest of T trees. Case x: There is one tree. Case x: No trees.
x is the case number (starting from 1).

## Could you solve Baekjoon 4803?

Certainly! Here's a Python solution for the Baekjoon 4803 problem:

```python
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(10**6)
input = sys.stdin.readline


def dfs(graph, visited, v, parent):
    visited[v] = True
    for neighbor in graph[v]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            if dfs(graph, visited, neighbor, v):
                return True
        elif parent != neighbor:
            return True
    return False

def count_trees(graph, n):
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    count = 0
    for v in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[v]:
            if not dfs(graph, visited, v, -1):
                count += 1
    return count

def solve():
    case = 1
    while True:
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        if n == 0 and m == 0:
            break

        graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v = map(int, input().split())
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)

        num_trees = count_trees(graph, n)

        if num_trees == 0:
            print(f"Case {case}: No trees.")
        elif num_trees == 1:
            print(f"Case {case}: There is one tree.")
        else:
            print(f"Case {case}: A forest of {num_trees} trees.")

        case += 1

solve()
```

You can run this code and provide the input as described in the problem statement. The code reads input until it encounters `n = m = 0`, and for each case, it constructs the graph and counts the number of trees using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. Finally, it prints the result based on the number of trees found in each case.

Please note that this solution assumes that the input is well-formed, meaning the input constraints are satisfied and the edges are valid within the given vertex range.
