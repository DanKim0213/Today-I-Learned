## Could you solve Baekjoon 18352?

Certainly! Baekjoon 18352 is another problem on the Baekjoon Online Judge platform. It involves finding the cities that are located at a specific distance (K) from a given starting city using breadth-first search (BFS).

Here's the Python code to solve the Baekjoon 18352 problem:

```python
from collections import deque
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline


def bfs(start, graph, distance, K):
    result = []
    queue = deque()
    queue.append(start)
    distance[start] = 0

    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()

        if distance[current] == K:
            # We have reached the desired distance from the start
            result.append(current)

        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            if distance[neighbor] == -1:
                distance[neighbor] = distance[current] + 1
                queue.append(neighbor)

    return result


# Main function to solve the problem
def solve():
    N, M, K, X = map(
        int, input().split()
    )  # Read the number of cities (N), roads (M), distance (K), and the starting city (X)
    graph = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]

    for _ in range(M):
        A, B = map(int, input().split())  # Read a road from city A to city B
        graph[A].append(B)

    distance = [-1] * (N + 1)  # Initialize the distance array

    result = bfs(X, graph, distance, K)

    if result:
        result.sort()
        for city in result:
            print(city)
    else:
        print(-1)


solve()
```

Make sure to provide the input for the problem as specified on the Baekjoon Online Judge platform. The code will output the cities that are located at a distance of K from the starting city X. If there are no such cities, it will output -1.

Note that this code assumes that the input is valid and follows the problem's constraints. It also assumes that the number of cities (N), number of roads (M), distance (K), starting city (X), and the roads connecting the cities are provided via standard input (console).
