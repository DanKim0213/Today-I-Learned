## Could you solve Baekjoon 17142?

```python
from collections import deque
from itertools import combinations
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

# Define directions: up, down, left, right
dx = [-1, 1, 0, 0]
dy = [0, 0, -1, 1]


# Function to check if a cell is within the grid and not a wall or visited
def is_valid(x, y, n):
    return 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < n


# Function to find the minimum time to spread the virus
def find_min_time(n, grid, viruses, empty_count):
    print("viruses: ", viruses)
    queue = deque()
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    time = [[-1] * n for _ in range(n)]

    for virus in viruses:
        x, y = virus
        queue.append((x, y))
        visited[x][y] = True
        time[x][y] = 0

    spread_count = 0
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()

        for i in range(4):
            nx, ny = x + dx[i], y + dy[i]

            if is_valid(nx, ny, n) and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] != 1:
                queue.append((nx, ny))
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                time[nx][ny] = time[x][y] + 1
                if grid[nx][ny] == 0:  # If an empty cell is infected
                    spread_count += 1
                    if spread_count == empty_count:  # If all empty cells are infected
                        return time[nx][ny]

    return float("inf")  # If it is not possible to infect all empty cells


# Main function to solve the problem
def solve():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())  # Read grid size and number of viruses
    grid = []  # Grid initialization
    viruses = []  # Virus positions
    empty_count = 0  # Count of empty cells

    for i in range(n):
        row = list(map(int, input().split()))
        grid.append(row)
        for j in range(n):
            if row[j] == 2:  # If the cell contains a virus
                viruses.append((i, j))
            elif row[j] == 0:  # If the cell is empty
                empty_count += 1

    min_time = float("inf")

    # Generate all possible combinations of active viruses
    for selected_viruses in combinations(viruses, m):
        result = find_min_time(n, grid, selected_viruses, empty_count)
        min_time = min(min_time, result)

    if empty_count == 0: # Empty count could be **0**
        print(0)
    elif min_time == float("inf"):  # If it is impossible to infect all empty cells
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(min_time)


solve()
```

```
input:
4 4
1 1 1 1
1 2 2 1
1 2 2 1
1 1 1 1

output: 0
```

## Do I better off going Dijkstra? 

No. BFS is the solution on this problem since it complies with First-in First-out.
