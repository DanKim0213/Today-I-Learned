## Could you solve Baekjoon 14503?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 14503 problem is commonly known as the "Robot Vacuum Cleaner" problem. It can be solved using a simulation approach. Here's a Python implementation for the problem:

```python
def clean_room(r, c, d):
    global count

    if room[r][c] == 0:
        room[r][c] = 2
        count += 1

    for _ in range(4):
        nd = (d + 3) % 4  # Rotate left

        nr, nc = r + directions[nd][0], c + directions[nd][1]

        if room[nr][nc] == 0:
            clean_room(nr, nc, nd)
            return

        d = nd  # Update direction

    # If all adjacent cells are not cleanable or walls
    nd = (d + 2) % 4  # Reverse direction
    nr, nc = r + directions[nd][0], c + directions[nd][1]

    if room[nr][nc] != 1:
        clean_room(nr, nc, d)

n, m = map(int, input().split())  # Size of the room
r, c, d = map(int, input().split())  # Initial position and direction
room = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]  # Room map

# 0: North, 1: East, 2: South, 3: West
directions = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]

count = 0  # Number of cleaned cells
clean_room(r, c, d)

print(count)
```

In this code, we define the `clean_room` function that performs the cleaning operation. It takes the current position (`r`, `c`) and direction (`d`) of the robot vacuum cleaner, as well as the global `count` variable to keep track of the number of cleaned cells.

Inside the function, we first check if the current cell is uncleaned (`room[r][c] == 0`). If it is, we mark it as cleaned (`room[r][c] = 2`) and increment the `count` variable.

Next, we iterate four times to check the adjacent cells in a counterclockwise manner. We calculate the new direction by rotating the current direction 90 degrees to the left (`nd = (d + 3) % 4`). We calculate the new position (`nr`, `nc`) based on the new direction.

If the new position is a cleanable cell (`room[nr][nc] == 0`), we recursively call the `clean_room` function with the new position and direction, and then return from the current recursive call.

If all adjacent cells are already cleaned or walls, we calculate the new direction by reversing the current direction (`nd = (d + 2) % 4`) and calculate the new position (`nr`, `nc`) based on the new direction.

If the new position is not a wall (`room[nr][nc] != 1`), we recursively call the `clean_room` function with the new position and the current direction (`d`).

In the main part of the code, we read the input, including the size of the room (`n`, `m`), the initial position (`r`, `c`), and the initial direction (`d`) of the robot vacuum cleaner. We also read the room map.

We define the `directions` list to store the movement directions based on the indexes: 0 for north, 1 for east, 2

 for south, and 3 for west.

Finally, we initialize the `count` variable to 0 and call the `clean_room` function with the initial position and direction. After the cleaning operation is completed, we print the final `count`, which represents the number of cleaned cells.
