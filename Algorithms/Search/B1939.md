## Could you solve Baekjoon 1939?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 1939 problem is known as "중량제한" (Weight Limit). Here's the Python code to solve it:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque


def bfs(graph, start, end, limit):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([(start, float('inf'))])
    visited.add(start)

    while queue:
        node, weight = queue.popleft()

        if node == end:
            return True

        for neighbor, edge_weight in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited and edge_weight >= limit:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, min(weight, edge_weight)))

    return False


# Read input values
n, m = map(int, input().split())

graph = defaultdict(list)
max_weight = 0

# Build the graph and find the maximum weight
for _ in range(m):
    a, b, weight = map(int, input().split())
    graph[a].append((b, weight))
    graph[b].append((a, weight))
    max_weight = max(max_weight, weight)

start, end = map(int, input().split())

# Perform binary search to find the maximum weight limit
left = 1
right = max_weight
result = 0

while left <= right:
    mid = (left + right) // 2

    if bfs(graph, start, end, mid):
        result = mid
        left = mid + 1
    else:
        right = mid - 1

# Print the result
print(result)
```

In this solution, we use a binary search combined with a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the maximum weight limit that allows passage from the start node to the end node.

First, we define a helper function called `bfs` that performs a BFS traversal on the graph, considering only edges with weights greater than or equal to the given limit. The function returns `True` if it can reach the end node within the weight limit, and `False` otherwise.

We read the input values `n` and `m`, representing the number of nodes and the number of edges, respectively.

Next, we build the graph using a defaultdict of lists. For each edge, we add the corresponding nodes and weights to the graph, keeping track of the maximum weight encountered.

Then, we read the start and end nodes.

We perform a binary search to find the maximum weight limit. Initially, the left boundary is set to 1 (minimum possible weight), and the right boundary is set to the maximum weight encountered. In each iteration, we calculate the mid-point of the boundaries and perform a BFS with the current mid value. If the BFS can reach the end node, we update the result and move the left boundary to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, we move the right boundary to `mid - 1`.

Finally, we print the result, which represents the maximum weight limit that allows passage from the start node to the end node.

The code assumes the input is read from standard input. The first line contains the values of `n` and `m`. The following `m` lines represent the edges, where each line contains three integers: the source node, the destination node, and the weight of the edge. The last line contains the start and end nodes. You may need to modify the code if your input format differs.
