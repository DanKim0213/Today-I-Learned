## Could you solve Baekjoon 1504?

Certainly! Baekjoon 1504 is another problem on the Baekjoon Online Judge platform. It involves finding the shortest path between two given vertices in a weighted undirected graph, with the condition that the path must pass through two specific intermediate vertices.

Here's the Python code to solve the Baekjoon 1504 problem:

```python
import heapq
import sys

def dijkstra(start, graph):
    # Initialize distances with infinity
    distances = {vertex: sys.maxsize for vertex in graph}
    distances[start] = 0

    # Use min-heap for efficient extraction of the vertex with minimum distance
    min_heap = []
    heapq.heappush(min_heap, (0, start))

    while min_heap:
        current_distance, current_vertex = heapq.heappop(min_heap)

        # Skip if already visited with a shorter distance
        if current_distance > distances[current_vertex]:
            continue

        for adjacent_vertex, weight in graph[current_vertex]:
            distance = current_distance + weight

            # Relaxation: Update the distance if a shorter path is found
            if distance < distances[adjacent_vertex]:
                distances[adjacent_vertex] = distance
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, (distance, adjacent_vertex))

    return distances

# Main function to solve the problem
def solve():
    N, E = map(int, input().split())  # Read the number of vertices (N) and edges (E)
    graph = {vertex: [] for vertex in range(1, N + 1)}

    for _ in range(E):
        u, v, w = map(int, input().split())  # Read an edge (u, v) with weight w
        graph[u].append((v, w))
        graph[v].append((u, w))

    v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())  # Read the intermediate vertices (v1 and v2)

    # Find the shortest paths from the starting vertex to v1, v2, and the ending vertex
    distances_start = dijkstra(1, graph)
    distances_v1 = dijkstra(v1, graph)
    distances_v2 = dijkstra(v2, graph)

    # Calculate the minimum distances for the three possible paths
    path1 = distances_start[v1] + distances_v1[v2] + distances_v2[N]
    path2 = distances_start[v2] + distances_v2[v1] + distances_v1[N]
    min_distance = min(path1, path2)

    if min_distance >= sys.maxsize:  # If there is no valid path
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(min_distance)

solve()
```

Make sure to provide the input for the problem as specified on the Baekjoon Online Judge platform. The code will output the minimum distance between the starting vertex (1) and the ending vertex (N) while passing through the two intermediate vertices (v1 and v2).

Note that this code assumes that the input is valid and follows the problem's constraints. It also assumes that the number of vertices (N), number of edges (E), the intermediate vertices (v1 and v2), and the graph's edges with weights are provided via standard input (console).
