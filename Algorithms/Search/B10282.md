## Could you solve Baekjoon 10282?

Certainly! Baekjoon 10282 is another problem on the Baekjoon Online Judge platform. It involves finding the minimum time it takes to infect all computers in a network, given the starting computer and the transmission time between computers.

Here's the Python code to solve the Baekjoon 10282 problem using Dijkstra's algorithm:

```python
import heapq
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline


def dijkstra(start, graph):
    # Initialize distances with infinity
    distances = [sys.maxsize] * (len(graph))
    distances[start] = 0

    # Use min-heap for efficient extraction of the vertex with minimum distance
    min_heap = []
    heapq.heappush(min_heap, (0, start))

    while min_heap:
        current_distance, current_vertex = heapq.heappop(min_heap)

        # Skip if already visited with a shorter distance
        if current_distance > distances[current_vertex]:
            continue

        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_vertex]:
            distance = current_distance + weight

            # Relaxation: Update the distance if a shorter path is found
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, (distance, neighbor))

    return distances


# Main function to solve the problem
def solve():
    T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases

    for _ in range(T):
        n, d, c = map(
            int, input().split()
        )  # Read the number of computers (n), number of dependencies (d), and the starting computer (c)

        graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]

        for _ in range(d):
            a, b, s = map(
                int, input().split()
            )  # Read a dependency from computer a to computer b with transmission time s
            graph[b].append((a, s))  # Reverse the dependency for Dijkstra's algorithm

        distances = dijkstra(c, graph)

        infected_computers = 0
        max_time = 0
        for distance in distances:
            if distance != sys.maxsize:
                infected_computers += 1
                max_time = max(max_time, distance)

        print(infected_computers, max_time)


solve()
```

Make sure to provide the input for the problem as specified on the Baekjoon Online Judge platform. The code will output the number of computers infected and the maximum time it takes to infect all computers, based on the given network and starting computer.

Note that this code assumes that the input is valid and follows the problem's constraints. It also assumes that the number of test cases (T), number of computers (n), number of dependencies (d), starting computer (c), the dependencies with transmission times, are provided via standard input (console).
