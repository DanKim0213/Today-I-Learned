## Could you solve Baekjoon 1890?

Certainly! Here's the Python code to solve Baekjoon 1890, which is the "점프" problem:

```python
def count_paths(n, board):
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]  # Initialize the dynamic programming table

    # Set the base case
    dp[0][0] = 1

    # Fill in the dynamic programming table
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if dp[i][j] == 0 or (i == n - 1 and j == n - 1):
                continue

            jump = board[i][j]

            if i + jump < n:
                dp[i + jump][j] += dp[i][j]

            if j + jump < n:
                dp[i][j + jump] += dp[i][j]

    # Return the number of paths to reach the bottom-right cell
    return dp[n - 1][n - 1]


n = int(input())
board = []
for _ in range(n):
    row = list(map(int, input().split()))
    board.append(row)

result = count_paths(n, board)
print(result)
```

In this code, the `count_paths` function implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It takes the input value `n`, which represents the size of the board, and the `board` itself, which represents the jump values for each cell. It calculates the number of paths to reach the bottom-right cell from the top-left cell.

The function uses a dynamic programming table, `dp`, where each element `dp[i][j]` represents the number of paths to reach the cell at row `i` and column `j`. The base case is set as `dp[0][0] = 1`, indicating that there is one path to the top-left cell.

The function then iterates through each cell in the board, starting from the top-left cell. For each cell at `board[i][j]`, it checks if there is a valid jump to the right or bottom cell. If there is, it updates the corresponding `dp` values by adding the number of paths from the current cell `dp[i][j]`.

Finally, the result is obtained from the `dp[n-1][n-1]` value, which represents the number of paths to reach the bottom-right cell.

The code assumes the input values `n` and the `board` are provided through standard input. The `board` is read row by row, with each row containing the jump values separated by spaces. If you want to test the code with sample input, you can replace the input reading part with specific values.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
