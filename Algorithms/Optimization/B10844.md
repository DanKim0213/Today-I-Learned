## Could you solve Baekjoon 10844?

Certainly! Here's the Python code to solve Baekjoon 10844, which is the "쉬운 계단 수" problem:

```python
def count_stair_numbers(n):
    dp = [[0] * 10 for _ in range(n + 1)]  # Initialize the dynamic programming table

    # Set the base case
    for i in range(1, 10):
        dp[1][i] = 1

    # Fill in the dynamic programming table
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        for j in range(10):
            if j == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j + 1]
            elif j == 9:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j + 1]

    # Calculate the total count of stair numbers
    count = sum(dp[n]) % 1000000000
    return count


n = int(input())
result = count_stair_numbers(n)
print(result)
```

In this code, the `count_stair_numbers` function implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It takes the input value `n`, which represents the number of digits, and calculates the count of "stair numbers" with `n` digits.

A "stair number" is defined as a number where each digit is either one less or one greater than the previous digit. For example, 45656 is a stair number because each digit satisfies the condition.

The function uses a dynamic programming table, `dp`, where each element `dp[i][j]` represents the count of stair numbers of length `i` whose last digit is `j`. The base case is set for `dp[1][1]` to `dp[1][9]`, where each element is initialized to 1.

Then, the function iterates through the remaining digits from `2` to `n`, and for each digit, it calculates the count of stair numbers by considering the adjacent digits. The count for `dp[i][j]` is determined by summing up the counts of `dp[i-1][j-1]` and `dp[i-1][j+1]`, except for the cases where `j` is at the boundary (0 or 9), in which case only one adjacent count is considered.

The final count is obtained by summing up all the counts in the last row of the dynamic programming table, and the result is taken modulo `1000000000` to handle large values.

The code assumes the input value `n` is provided through standard input. If you want to test the code with sample input, you can replace the line `n = int(input())` with a specific value, such as `n = 3`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

## Thoughts

(a) + x -> (ab) + x -> (abc) + x. For example, (a)2 = (12) + (32) and (ab)2 = (212) + (232, 432).
