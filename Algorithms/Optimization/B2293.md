## Could you solve Baekjoon 2293?

Certainly! Here's the solution to Baekjoon 2293 using dynamic programming:

```python
def count_coin_combinations(coins, target):
    dp = [0] * (target + 1)
    dp[0] = 1

    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, target + 1):
            dp[i] += dp[i - coin]

    return dp[target]


# Read the input values of n and k
n, k = map(int, input().split())

# Read the coin values
coins = []
for _ in range(n):
    coin = int(input())
    coins.append(coin)

# Calculate and print the number of coin combinations
combinations = count_coin_combinations(coins, k)
print(combinations)
```

In this solution, we define the function `count_coin_combinations` that takes a list of coin values `coins` and a target value `target` as input. It calculates the number of combinations to make the target value using the given coins.

We initialize a DP table `dp` of length `target + 1` with all values set to 0. Each element `dp[i]` represents the number of combinations to make the value `i`.

We iterate through each coin value in the `coins` list. For each coin, we iterate from its value (`coin`) to the target value (`target`) and update the DP table. We add the value of `dp[i - coin]` to `dp[i]`, which represents the number of combinations to make the value `i - coin`. By doing so, we accumulate all the possible combinations that can be formed using the current coin.

After iterating through all the coins, the final value of `dp[target]` will represent the total number of combinations to make the target value. We return this value.

We read the input values of `n` (the number of coins) and `k` (the target value) from the user. Then, we read the coin values one by one and store them in the `coins` list. Finally, we call the `count_coin_combinations` function with the `coins` list and the target value `k`, and store the result in the variable `combinations`. Finally, we print the value of `combinations`.

I hope this solves Baekjoon 2293 using dynamic programming. Let me know if you have any further questions!
