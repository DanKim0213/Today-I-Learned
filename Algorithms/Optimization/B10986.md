## Could you solve Baekjoon 10986?

Certainly! I'd be happy to help you solve Baekjoon 10986 in Python. This problem is known as "나머지 합" (Sum of Remainders) on the Baekjoon Online Judge platform. Here's the problem statement for reference:

## Problem Statement (Baekjoon 10986)

Given an array of `N` integers and a positive integer `M`, you need to count the number of subarrays whose sum modulo `M` is 0.

## Input

The first line of input contains two integers `N` and `M` (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 1,000,000, 2 ≤ `M` ≤ 10,000), representing the number of integers and the modulo value, respectively.

The second line of input contains `N` integers separated by a space, which are the elements of the array. Each integer is between 0 and 1,000 (inclusive).

## Output

Print the number of subarrays whose sum modulo `M` is 0.

Now, let's write a Python function to solve this problem:

```python
def solve_sum_of_remainders(nums, M):
    # Initialize the prefix sum dictionary
    prefix_sums = {0: 1}
    current_sum = 0
    count = 0

    # Calculate the prefix sum and count the number of subarrays with sum modulo M
    for num in nums:
        current_sum = (current_sum + num) % M
        count += prefix_sums.get(current_sum, 0)
        prefix_sums[current_sum] = prefix_sums.get(current_sum, 0) + 1

    return count
```

Now, you can use this function to solve the problem by providing the array of integers (`nums`) and the modulo value (`M`) as arguments. Here's an example usage:

```python
N, M = map(int, input().split())
nums = list(map(int, input().split()))

result = solve_sum_of_remainders(nums, M)
print(result)
```

This solution uses the concept of prefix sums and a dictionary to keep track of the counts of each remainder value. It iterates over the array, calculating the prefix sum at each step and counting the number of subarrays with sum modulo `M` by looking up the corresponding count in the prefix sums dictionary. It then updates the prefix sums dictionary accordingly. Finally, it outputs the count.

Please note that this code assumes the input will be provided through standard input (stdin) and the result will be printed to standard output (stdout). You can adjust the I/O operations according to your specific requirements.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
