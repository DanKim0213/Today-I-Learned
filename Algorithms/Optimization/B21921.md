## Could you solve Baekjoon 21921?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 21921 problem is called "블로그" (Blog). The problem involves finding the maximum number of visitors and the number of days with the maximum number of visitors given the number of days and the daily visitor count data.

Here's the Python solution for the Baekjoon 21921 problem:

```python
import sys

def find_max_visitors(n, x, visitors):
    max_visitors = sum(visitors[:x])
    max_days = 1

    curr_visitors = max_visitors
    for i in range(x, n):
        curr_visitors = curr_visitors + visitors[i] - visitors[i - x]
        if curr_visitors > max_visitors:
            max_visitors = curr_visitors
            max_days = 1
        elif curr_visitors == max_visitors:
            max_days += 1

    return max_visitors, max_days

def main():
    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    visitors = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))

    max_visitors, max_days = find_max_visitors(n, x, visitors)
    if max_visitors == 0:
        print("SAD")
    else:
        print(max_visitors)
        print(max_days)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

To use this solution, you can provide the input values through standard input. The first line should contain two integers separated by a space: `n` (the number of days) and `x` (the number of consecutive days to consider). Then, you need to provide a single line containing `n` integers representing the number of visitors for each day.

After running the code, it will output either "SAD" if there are no visitors or the maximum number of visitors, followed by the number of days with the maximum number of visitors.
