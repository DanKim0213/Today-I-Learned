## Could you solve Baekjoon 2193?

Certainly! Here's the solution to Baekjoon 2193 using dynamic programming:

```python
def count_binary_strings(n):
    # Initialize the base cases
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = 1

    # Fill the DP table iteratively
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]

    return dp[n]


# Read the input value of N
N = int(input())

# Calculate and print the count of binary strings
count = count_binary_strings(N)
print(count)
```

In this solution, we define the function `count_binary_strings` that takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the count of valid binary strings of length `n`. We use dynamic programming to fill a DP table `dp`, where `dp[i]` represents the count of valid binary strings of length `i`.

We initialize the base cases: `dp[1]` is set to 1 because there is only one valid binary string of length 1. Then, we iterate from 2 to `n` and fill the DP table iteratively using the recurrence relation `dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]`. This relation states that the count of valid binary strings of length `i` is the sum of the counts of valid binary strings of length `i - 1` and `i - 2`.

Finally, we return the value of `dp[n]`, which represents the count of valid binary strings of length `n`.

We read the input value of `N` from the user and calculate the count of binary strings using the `count_binary_strings` function. The result is stored in the variable `count` and printed.

I hope this solves Baekjoon 2193 using dynamic programming. Let me know if you have any further questions!
