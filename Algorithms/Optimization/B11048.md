## Could you solve Baekjoon 11048

Certainly! Here's the Python code to solve Baekjoon 11048, which is the "이동하기" problem:

```python
def max_candy(collection):
    n = len(collection)
    m = len(collection[0])

    dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]  # Initialize the dynamic programming table

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1]) + collection[i - 1][j - 1]

    return dp[n][m]


n, m = map(int, input().split())
collection = []
for _ in range(n):
    row = list(map(int, input().split()))
    collection.append(row)

result = max_candy(collection)
print(result)
```

In this code, the `max_candy` function implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It takes the input value `collection`, which represents the collection of candies in each cell, and calculates the maximum number of candies that can be collected while moving from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.

The function uses a dynamic programming table, `dp`, where each element `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of candies that can be collected when reaching the cell at row `i` and column `j`. The base case is set as `dp[0][0] = 0`.

The function then iterates through each cell in the collection, starting from the top-left cell. For each cell at `collection[i][j]`, the maximum number of candies that can be collected is determined by taking the maximum of three possible paths: coming from the cell above (`dp[i-1][j]`), from the cell on the left (`dp[i][j-1]`), or from the diagonal cell (`dp[i-1][j-1]`). The maximum is then added to the current cell's value `collection[i][j]`.

The final result is stored in `dp[n][m]`, representing the maximum number of candies that can be collected while moving to the bottom-right cell.

The code assumes the input values `n` and `m` are provided through standard input as the number of rows and columns in the collection, respectively. The collection itself is also read from standard input. If you want to test the code with sample input, you can replace the input reading part with specific values.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
