## Could you solve Baekjoon 11053?

Certainly! Here's the solution to Baekjoon 11053 using dynamic programming:

```python
def longest_increasing_subsequence(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    dp = [1] * n

    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)

    return max(dp)


# Read the input value of N
N = int(input())

# Read the sequence of numbers
sequence = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Calculate and print the length of the longest increasing subsequence
length = longest_increasing_subsequence(sequence)
print(length)
```

In this solution, we define the function `longest_increasing_subsequence` that takes a list of numbers `nums` as input and calculates the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the given sequence.

We initialize a DP table `dp` of length `n` (where `n` is the length of the input sequence) with all values set to 1. Each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`.

We iterate through the input sequence starting from index 1. For each index `i`, we compare it with all previous indices `j` (from 0 to `i-1`). If `nums[i]` is greater than `nums[j]`, it means that we can extend the increasing subsequence ending at index `j` by including the number at index `i`. In this case, we update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value (`dp[i]`) and the length of the subsequence ending at `j` plus 1 (`dp[j] + 1`).

Finally, we return the maximum value in the `dp` table, which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the given sequence.

We read the input value of `N` from the user, representing the length of the sequence. Then, we read the sequence of numbers from the user and store it in the variable `sequence`. We call the `longest_increasing_subsequence` function with the sequence as the input and store the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the variable `length`. Finally, we print the value of `length`.

I hope this solves Baekjoon 11053 using dynamic programming. Let me know if you have any further questions!
