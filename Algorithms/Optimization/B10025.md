## Could you solve Baekjoon 10025?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 10025 problem is called "게으른 백곰" (Lazy Bear). The problem involves calculating the maximum amount of fish a lazy bear can eat given a number of fish piles and their distances from the bear.

Here's the Python solution for the Baekjoon 10025 problem:

```python
import sys

def calculate_max_fish(n, k, piles):
    max_fish = 0
    max_range = 2 * k + 1
    fish_counts = [0] * 1000001

    for pile in piles:
        fish_counts[pile[1]] = pile[0]

    # Calculate the maximum fish count using sliding window technique
    fish_sum = sum(fish_counts[:max_range])
    max_fish = fish_sum

    for i in range(max_range, 1000001):
        fish_sum = fish_sum - fish_counts[i - max_range] + fish_counts[i]
        max_fish = max(max_fish, fish_sum)

    return max_fish

def main():
    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    piles = []

    for _ in range(n):
        g, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        piles.append((g, x))

    result = calculate_max_fish(n, k, piles)
    print(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

To use this solution, you can provide the input values through standard input. The first line should contain two integers separated by a space: `n` (the number of fish piles) and `k` (the maximum distance the bear can reach). Then, you need to provide `n` lines, each containing two integers separated by a space: `g` (the number of fish in the pile) and `x` (the distance of the pile from the bear).

After running the code, it will output the maximum amount of fish the lazy bear can eat.
