## Could you solve Baekjoon 1309?

Certainly! Here's the solution to Baekjoon 1309 using dynamic programming:

```python
def count_ways(n):
    MOD = 9901

    # Initialize the DP table with base cases
    dp = [[0] * 3 for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[1][0] = dp[1][1] = dp[1][2] = 1

    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # Calculate the number of ways with no lion in the current row
        dp[i][0] = (dp[i - 1][0] + dp[i - 1][1] + dp[i - 1][2]) % MOD

        # Calculate the number of ways with a lion in the left cell of the current row
        dp[i][1] = (dp[i - 1][0] + dp[i - 1][2]) % MOD

        # Calculate the number of ways with a lion in the right cell of the current row
        dp[i][2] = (dp[i - 1][0] + dp[i - 1][1]) % MOD

    # Calculate the total number of ways by summing up the values in the last row
    total_ways = sum(dp[n]) % MOD
    return total_ways


# Read the input value of n
n = int(input())

# Calculate and print the number of ways
ways = count_ways(n)
print(ways)
```

In this solution, we define the function `count_ways` that takes an integer `n` as input. It calculates the number of ways to arrange `n` rows of cages with at most one lion per row, considering the condition that no two adjacent cages in the same row can contain lions.

We initialize a 2D DP table `dp` of size `(n + 1) x 3` with all values set to 0. Each element `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to arrange `i` rows of cages with a lion in the `j`-th cell of the current row.

We set the base cases where for `i = 1`, all cells in the first row can have a lion, so `dp[1][0]`, `dp[1][1]`, and `dp[1][2]` are set to 1.

Next, we iterate from `i = 2` to `n` and for each `i`, we calculate the number of ways for each cell in the current row based on the values in the previous row.

- `dp[i][0]` represents the number of ways with no lion in the current row, which is the sum of the values in the previous row (`dp[i - 1][0]`, `dp[i - 1][1]`, and `dp[i - 1][2]`).
- `dp[i][1]` represents the number of ways with a lion in the left cell of the current row, which is the sum of the values in the previous row except for the right cell (`dp[i - 1][0]` and `dp[i - 1][2]`).
- `dp[i][2]` represents the number of ways with a lion in the right cell of the current row, which is the sum of the values in the previous row except for the left cell (`dp[i - 1][0]` and `dp[i - 1][1]`).

After completing the iterations, the total number of ways to arrange `n` rows of cages is given by the sum of the values in the last row

 (`dp[n][0]`, `dp[n][1]`, and `dp[n][2]`). We calculate the sum modulo 9901 to keep the result within the specified range.

Finally, we read the input value of `n` from the user, call the `count_ways` function with `n` as the input, and store the result in the variable `ways`. Finally, we print the value of `ways`.

I hope this solves Baekjoon 1309 using dynamic programming. Let me know if you have any further questions!
