## Could you solve Baekjoon 2294?

Certainly! Here's the solution to Baekjoon 2294 using dynamic programming:

```python
def min_coin_count(coins, target):
    INF = float('inf')
    dp = [INF] * (target + 1)
    dp[0] = 0

    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, target + 1):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)

    return dp[target] if dp[target] != INF else -1


# Read the input values of n and k
n, k = map(int, input().split())

# Read the coin values
coins = []
for _ in range(n):
    coin = int(input())
    coins.append(coin)

# Calculate and print the minimum number of coins needed
min_count = min_coin_count(coins, k)
print(min_count)
```

In this solution, we define the function `min_coin_count` that takes a list of coin values `coins` and a target value `target` as input. It calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make the target value using the given coins.

We initialize a DP table `dp` of length `target + 1` with all values set to infinity (except for `dp[0]` which is set to 0 since no coins are needed to make a target value of 0). Each element `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of coins needed to make the value `i`.

We iterate through each coin value in the `coins` list. For each coin, we iterate from its value (`coin`) to the target value (`target`) and update the DP table. We compare `dp[i]` with `dp[i - coin] + 1` and take the minimum of these two values. This represents the minimum number of coins needed to make the value `i` using the current coin.

After iterating through all the coins, the final value of `dp[target]` will represent the minimum number of coins needed to make the target value. If the value is still infinity (`INF`), it means that it is not possible to make the target value using the given coins, so we return -1. Otherwise, we return the minimum coin count.

We read the input values of `n` (the number of coins) and `k` (the target value) from the user. Then, we read the coin values one by one and store them in the `coins` list. Finally, we call the `min_coin_count` function with the `coins` list and the target value `k`, and store the result in the variable `min_count`. Finally, we print the value of `min_count`.

I hope this solves Baekjoon 2294 using dynamic programming. Let me know if you have any further questions!
