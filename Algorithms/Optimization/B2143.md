## Problem Statement (Baekjoon 2143)

Given two arrays `A` and `B` of sizes `N` and `M` respectively, you need to find the number of pairs of subarrays (one from `A` and one from `B`) whose sums are equal to a given value `T`.

## Input

The first line of input contains an integer `T` (-1,000,000,000 ≤ `T` ≤ 1,000,000,000), representing the target sum.

The second line of input contains an integer `N` (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 1,000), representing the size of array `A`.

The third line of input contains `N` integers separated by a space, which are the elements of array `A`. Each integer is between -1,000 and 1,000.

The fourth line of input contains an integer `M` (1 ≤ `M` ≤ 1,000), representing the size of array `B`.

The fifth line of input contains `M` integers separated by a space, which are the elements of array `B`. Each integer is between -1,000 and 1,000.

## Output

Print the number of pairs of subarrays whose sums are equal to `T`.

Now, let's write a Python function to solve this problem:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def solve_sum_of_two_arrays(T, A, B):
    # Calculate the prefix sums of array A
    prefix_sum_A = [0]
    for num in A:
        prefix_sum_A.append(prefix_sum_A[-1] + num)

    # Calculate the prefix sums of array B
    prefix_sum_B = [0]
    for num in B:
        prefix_sum_B.append(prefix_sum_B[-1] + num)

    # Count the number of pairs of subarrays with sums equal to T
    count = 0
    sum_counts = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(len(prefix_sum_A)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(prefix_sum_A)):
            sum_A = prefix_sum_A[j] - prefix_sum_A[i]
            sum_counts[sum_A] += 1

    for i in range(len(prefix_sum_B)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(prefix_sum_B)):
            sum_B = prefix_sum_B[j] - prefix_sum_B[i]
            count += sum_counts[T - sum_B]

    return count
```

Now, you can use this function to solve the problem by providing the target sum (`T`), the arrays `A` and `B` as arguments. Here's an example usage:

```python
T = int(input())
N = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))
M = int(input())
B = list(map(int, input().split()))

result = solve_sum_of_two_arrays(T, A, B)
print(result)
```

This solution uses prefix sums to efficiently calculate the sums of subarrays. It iterates over the two arrays `A` and `B` to compute the prefix sums. Then, it counts the number of pairs of subarrays by iterating over all possible subarrays of `A` and `B` and checking if their sums equal `T`. The count is updated accordingly. Finally, it outputs the count.

Please note that this code assumes the input will be provided through standard input (stdin) and the result will be

 printed to standard output (stdout). You can adjust the I/O operations according to your specific requirements.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
