## Q. "Divide and Conquer" vs "Decrease and Conquer" 

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm):

> The divide-and-conquer paradigm is often used to find an optimal solution of a problem. Its basic idea is to decompose a given problem into two or more similar, but simpler, subproblems, to solve them in turn, and to compose their solutions to solve the given problem.

> The name "divide and conquer" is sometimes applied to algorithms that reduce each problem to only one sub-problem, such as the binary search algorithm for finding a record in a sorted list.

> Under this broad definition, however, every algorithm that uses recursion or loops could be regarded as a "divide-and-conquer algorithm". 

> Therefore, some authors consider that the name "divide and conquer" should be used only when each problem may generate two or more subproblems.[3] The name decrease and conquer has been proposed instead for the single-subproblem class.
