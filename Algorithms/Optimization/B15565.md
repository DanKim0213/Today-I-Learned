## Could you solve Baekjoon 15565?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 15565 problem is called "귀여운 라이언" (Cute Lions). The problem involves finding the minimum length of a subarray that contains a specific number of a given type of element.

Here's the Python solution for the Baekjoon 15565 problem:

```python
import sys

def find_minimum_length(n, k, nums):
    min_length = float('inf')
    left = 0
    count = 0

    # Iterate through the array and maintain a sliding window
    for right in range(n):
        if nums[right] == 1:
            count += 1

        # Shrink the window from the left to find the minimum length
        while count >= k:
            min_length = min(min_length, right - left + 1)

            if nums[left] == 1:
                count -= 1

            left += 1

    if min_length == float('inf'):
        return -1

    return min_length

def main():
    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    nums = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))

    result = find_minimum_length(n, k, nums)
    print(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

To use this solution, you can provide the input values through standard input. The first line should contain two integers separated by a space: `n` (the number of elements in the array) and `k` (the desired number of a specific type of element). Then, you need to provide a single line containing `n` integers representing the elements in the array.

After running the code, it will output the minimum length of a subarray that contains `k` number of the desired type of element. If there is no such subarray, it will output -1.
