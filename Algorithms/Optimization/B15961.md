## Could you solve Baekjoon 15961?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 15961 problem is called "회전 초밥" (Rotating Sushi). The problem involves finding the maximum number of different types of sushi a person can eat given a rotating conveyor belt with various types of sushi.

Here's the Python solution for the Baekjoon 15961 problem:

```python
import sys

def find_max_sushi(n, belt, k, coupon):
    count = 0
    max_count = 0
    types = {}
    
    # Count the types of sushi in the initial window
    for i in range(k):
        if belt[i] not in types:
            types[belt[i]] = 1
            count += 1
        else:
            types[belt[i]] += 1

    # Add the coupon sushi to the count
    if coupon not in types:
        types[coupon] = 1
        count += 1
    else:
        types[coupon] += 1

    max_count = count

    # Slide the window and update the count
    for i in range(k, n+k):
        # Remove the sushi going out of the window
        types[belt[i-k]] -= 1
        if types[belt[i-k]] == 0:
            del types[belt[i-k]]
            count -= 1

        # Add the new sushi entering the window
        if belt[i % n] not in types:
            types[belt[i % n]] = 1
            count += 1
        else:
            types[belt[i % n]] += 1

        # Update the maximum count
        max_count = max(max_count, count)

        # Break early if all types of sushi are already eaten
        if max_count == k + 1:
            break

    return max_count

def main():
    n, d, k, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    belt = []
    for _ in range(n):
        sushi = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        belt.append(sushi)

    result = find_max_sushi(n, belt, k, c)
    print(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

To use this solution, you can provide the input values through standard input. The first line should contain four integers separated by a space: `n` (the number of sushi on the conveyor belt), `d` (the number of types of sushi), `k` (the number of consecutive sushi to eat), and `c` (the coupon sushi). Then, you need to provide `n` lines, each containing an integer representing the type of sushi at that position on the conveyor belt.

After running the code, it will output the maximum number of different types of sushi a person can eat.
