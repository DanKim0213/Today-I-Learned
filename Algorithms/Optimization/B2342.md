## Could you solve Baekjoon 2342?

iCertainly! The Baekjoon 2342 problem involves finding the minimum amount of energy required to perform a sequence of dance steps. Here's a Python solution for the problem:

```python
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(10**6)

INF = float('inf')

def get_energy(move, to):
    if move == 0:
        return 2
    elif move == to:
        return 1
    elif abs(move - to) == 2:
        return 4
    else:
        return 3


def solve(steps, i, left, right, dp):
    if i == len(steps) -1:
        return 0

    if dp[i][left][right] != -1:
        return dp[i][left][right]

    move = steps[i]
    min_energy = INF

    if left == move:
        min_energy = min(min_energy, solve(steps, i+1, move, right, dp) + get_energy(left, move))
    elif right == move:
        min_energy = min(min_energy, solve(steps, i+1, left, move, dp) + get_energy(right, move))
    else:
        min_energy = min(min_energy, solve(steps, i+1, move, right, dp) + get_energy(left, move))
        min_energy = min(min_energy, solve(steps, i+1, left, move, dp) + get_energy(right, move))

    dp[i][left][right] = min_energy
    return min_energy


def solution():
    steps = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [[[-1] * 5 for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(len(steps))]
    result = solve(steps, 0, 0, 0, dp)
    print(result)


solution()
```

In this solution, the `get_energy` function calculates the energy required to perform a dance step based on the current and next positions. It returns the energy value according to the given conditions.

The `solve` function is a recursive function that implements dynamic programming to calculate the minimum energy required for the sequence of dance steps. It keeps track of the current index `i`, the current left and right positions, and the dynamic programming table `dp`. The function recursively explores different options and chooses the one with the minimum energy. It stores the computed values in the `dp` table to avoid recomputation.

The `solution` function reads the input from the user, initializes the dynamic programming table, and calls the `solve` function to calculate the minimum energy. Finally, it prints the result.

Please note that this solution assumes the input is given through standard input (stdin) and the output is printed to standard output (stdout) as per the requirements of the Baekjoon 2342 problem. You can modify the code accordingly if you prefer a different input/output method.

## What is the time complexity of the provided solution?

The time complexity of the provided solution for Baekjoon 2342 is O(N), where N is the number of dance steps.

The solution uses dynamic programming with memoization to avoid redundant computations. It maintains a three-dimensional `dp` table to store the computed minimum energy values. The size of this table is determined by the number of dance steps and the number of possible positions for the left and right foot.

Since each dance step can be in one of five positions (0, 1, 2, 3, 4), the `dp` table has dimensions of `N + 1` (number of steps) × 5 (left position) × 5 (right position). Initializing this table takes O(N) time.

The `solve` function performs a recursive exploration of different dance step combinations. However, due to memoization, each unique state is computed only once. This ensures that the recursion tree has a maximum depth of N, and each state is visited at most once. Therefore, the overall time complexity is dominated by the initialization of the `dp` table, which is O(N).

In summary, the time complexity of the solution is O(N), where N is the number of dance steps.

## Why do we store min\_energy? 

TBD

## Why does the dp have three dimentions? 

dp[step][left][right] depends on the later steps to figure out whether the current step is meaningful.

## I'd like to implement the solution as for-loop

```python

def solve(steps, dp):
    N = len(steps)
    for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
        move = steps[i]
        for left in range(5):
            for right in range(5):
                if i == N - 1:
                    dp[i][left][right] = 0
                else:
                    min_energy = INF
                    if left == move:
                        min_energy = min(
                            min_energy, dp[i + 1][left][right] + get_energy(left, move)
                        )
                    elif right == move:
                        min_energy = min(
                            min_energy, dp[i + 1][left][right] + get_energy(right, move)
                        )
                    else:
                        min_energy = min(
                            min_energy, dp[i + 1][move][right] + get_energy(left, move)
                        )
                        min_energy = min(
                            min_energy, dp[i + 1][left][move] + get_energy(right, move)
                        )
                    dp[i][left][right] = min_energy
    return dp[0][0][0]
```

## Isn't the substructure coming from the beginning optimal?

In the case of Baekjoon 2342, the substructure coming from the beginning is not directly optimal for solving the problem efficiently. While it is possible to solve the problem by considering the substructure from the beginning, it would typically lead to an inefficient solution.

If we were to consider the substructure from the beginning, we would need to exhaustively explore all possible combinations of moves and compute the energy for each combination. This would result in a brute-force approach with an exponential time complexity, which is not feasible for larger inputs.

On the other hand, by considering the substructure from the end, we can break down the problem into smaller subproblems and use dynamic programming techniques like memoization or tabulation to avoid redundant calculations and optimize the solution. This allows us to find the minimum energy efficiently with a polynomial time complexity.

Therefore, while it is technically possible to consider the substructure from the beginning, it would not lead to an optimal and efficient solution for the given problem. By considering the substructure from the end, we can apply the principle of optimality and use dynamic programming to find the minimum energy in an efficient manner.
