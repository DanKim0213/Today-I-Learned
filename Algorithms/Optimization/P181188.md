## Solution

```python
def solution1(targets):
    targets.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    answer = 0
    end = 0

    for i in range(0, len(targets)):
        if end > targets[i][0]:
            continue

        end = targets[i][1]
        answer += 1
    return answer


def solution2(targets):
    targets.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    answer = 0
    end = 0

    for target in targets:
        s, e = target
        if end <= s:
            end = e
            answer += 1
        elif end > s and end > e:
            end = e

    return answer

```

## What I learned

To solve problems, you need to **figure out how it works**.

Sometimes, you need to solve the problem regardless of considering which variables are required or not.

And then, you can figure out how it works. Finally, you can refactor your code.

```python
# Record `src` and `end` to indicate the available range to shoot a missile
# However, I figured out `src` isn't required
def solution1_deprecated(targets):
    targets.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

    answer = 0
    src = end = 0

    for target in targets:
        s, e = target
        if end > s:
            src = s
            continue
        answer += 1
        src = s # E: local variable 'src' is assigned to but never used
        end = e
    return answer


# The same goes for this solution
def solution2_deprecated(targets):
    targets.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    answer = 0
    src = end = 0

    for target in targets:
        s, e = target
        if end <= s:
            src, end = s, e
            answer += 1
        else:  # end > s:
            src = s
            if end > e:
                end = e

    return answer

```
