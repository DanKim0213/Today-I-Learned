## Could you solve Baekjoon 11057?

Certainly! Here's the Python code to solve Baekjoon 11057, which is the "오르막 수" problem:

```python
def count_increasing_numbers(n):
    dp = [[0] * 10 for _ in range(n + 1)]  # Initialize the dynamic programming table

    # Set the base case
    dp[1] = [1] * 10

    # Fill in the dynamic programming table
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        for j in range(10):
            dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i - 1][: j + 1])

    # Calculate the total count of increasing numbers
    count = sum(dp[n])
    return count % 10007


n = int(input())
result = count_increasing_numbers(n)
print(result)
```

In this code, the `count_increasing_numbers` function implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It takes the input value `n`, which represents the number of digits, and calculates the count of increasing numbers with `n` digits.

The function uses a dynamic programming table, `dp`, where each element `dp[i][j]` represents the count of increasing numbers of length `i` whose last digit is `j`. The base case is set for `dp[1][0]` to `dp[1][9]`, where each element is initialized to 1.

Then, the function iterates through the remaining digits from `2` to `n`, and for each digit, it calculates the count of increasing numbers by summing up the counts of valid previous digits. The valid previous digits are from `j` to `9`, as the numbers need to be in non-decreasing order.

The final count is obtained by summing up all the counts in the last row of the dynamic programming table, and the result is taken modulo `10007` to handle large values.

The code assumes the input value `n` is provided through standard input. If you want to test the code with sample input, you can replace the line `n = int(input())` with a specific value, such as `n = 3`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
