## Could you solve Baekjoon 1912?

Certainly! Here's the solution to Baekjoon 1912 using dynamic programming:

```python
def max_subarray_sum(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    dp = [0] * n
    dp[0] = nums[0]
    max_sum = dp[0]

    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i] = max(nums[i], dp[i-1] + nums[i])
        max_sum = max(max_sum, dp[i])

    return max_sum


# Read the input value of N
N = int(input())

# Read the sequence of numbers
sequence = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Calculate and print the maximum subarray sum
max_sum = max_subarray_sum(sequence)
print(max_sum)
```

In this solution, we define the function `max_subarray_sum` that takes a list of numbers `nums` as input and calculates the maximum sum of a subarray within the given sequence.

We initialize a DP table `dp` of length `n` (where `n` is the length of the input sequence) with all values set to 0. Each element `dp[i]` represents the maximum sum of a subarray ending at index `i`.

We iterate through the input sequence starting from index 1. For each index `i`, we calculate the maximum sum of a subarray ending at index `i` by considering two cases: either including the number at index `i` in the subarray or starting a new subarray at index `i`. We take the maximum of these two values and store it in `dp[i]`.

We also maintain a variable `max_sum` to keep track of the maximum subarray sum found so far. We update `max_sum` whenever we find a new maximum subarray sum in the DP table.

Finally, we return the value of `max_sum`, which represents the maximum sum of a subarray within the given sequence.

We read the input value of `N` from the user, representing the length of the sequence. Then, we read the sequence of numbers from the user and store it in the variable `sequence`. We call the `max_subarray_sum` function with the sequence as the input and store the maximum subarray sum in the variable `max_sum`. Finally, we print the value of `max_sum`.

I hope this solves Baekjoon 1912 using dynamic programming. Let me know if you have any further questions!
