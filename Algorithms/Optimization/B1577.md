## Could you solve Baekjoon 1577?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 1577 problem, also known as the "Rest Area" problem, can be solved using a dynamic programming approach. Here's a Python implementation for the problem:

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())  # Size of the map
k = int(input())  # Number of rest areas
rest_areas = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(k)]  # Rest area coordinates

dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]  # Dynamic programming table
dp[0][0] = 1  # Initialize the starting point

for i in range(n + 1):
    for j in range(m + 1):
        if i > 0:
            if [i - 1, j, i, j] not in rest_areas and [i, j, i - 1, j] not in rest_areas:
                dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j]
        if j > 0:
            if [i, j - 1, i, j] not in rest_areas and [i, j, i, j - 1] not in rest_areas:
                dp[i][j] += dp[i][j - 1]

print(dp[n][m])
```

In this code, we first read the input, including the size of the map (`n`, `m`), and the number of rest areas (`k`). We then read the coordinates of the rest areas.

We initialize a dynamic programming table `dp` of size `(n+1) x (m+1)`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of possible paths to reach cell `(i, j)`.

We set `dp[0][0] = 1` to represent the starting point. Then, we iterate over all cells in the map using two nested loops. For each cell `(i, j)`, we check if we can move to it from the left or from above.

If we can move from the left `(i-1, j)` to `(i, j)`, and the line segment between the two cells is not a rest area (i.e., `[i - 1, j, i, j]` and `[i, j, i - 1, j]` are not present in the `rest_areas` list), we add `dp[i-1][j]` to `dp[i][j]`.

Similarly, if we can move from above `(i, j-1)` to `(i, j)`, and the line segment between the two cells is not a rest area, we add `dp[i][j-1]` to `dp[i][j]`.

Finally, we print `dp[n][m]`, which represents the number of possible paths to reach the bottom-right cell `(n, m)` of the map while avoiding the rest areas.
