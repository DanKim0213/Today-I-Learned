## Solution

```python
def main():
    def solve(idx, open1, open2):
        if idx == M:
            return 0

        if dp[idx][open1][open2] != -1:
            return dp[idx][open1][open2]

        open1_cnt = solve(idx + 1, order[idx], open2) + abs(order[idx] - open1)
        open2_cnt = solve(idx + 1, open1, order[idx]) + abs(order[idx] - open2)

        dp[idx][open1][open2] = min(open1_cnt, open2_cnt)
        return dp[idx][open1][open2]

    N = int(input())
    open1, open2 = map(int, input().split())
    order = []
    M = int(input())
    for _ in range(M):
        order.append(int(input()))

    dp = [[[-1] * (N + 1) for _ in range(N + 1)] for _ in range(M)]
    print(solve(0, open1, open2))


main()

```
