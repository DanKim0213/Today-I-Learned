# 1로 만들기 

## Could you solve Baekjoon 1463?

Certainly! Here's the Python code to solve Baekjoon 1463, which is the "1로 만들기" problem:

```python
def make_one(n):
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)  # Initialize the dynamic programming table
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1  # Subtracting 1 from the previous number

        if i % 2 == 0:
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i // 2] + 1)  # Dividing by 2

        if i % 3 == 0:
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i // 3] + 1)  # Dividing by 3

    return dp[n]  # Return the minimum number of operations


n = int(input())
result = make_one(n)
print(result)
```

In this code, the `make_one` function implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It takes the input value `n`, which represents the target number, and calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform `n` into 1.

The function uses a dynamic programming table, `dp`, where each element represents the minimum number of operations for the corresponding index `i`. It starts from `i = 2` and iteratively calculates the minimum number of operations based on the following rules:

1. Subtract 1 from the previous number (`dp[i-1] + 1`).
2. If `i` is divisible by 2, divide it by 2 and calculate the minimum number of operations (`dp[i//2] + 1`).
3. If `i` is divisible by 3, divide it by 3 and calculate the minimum number of operations (`dp[i//3] + 1`).

The final result is stored in `dp[n]`, representing the minimum number of operations required to transform `n` into 1.

The code assumes the input value `n` is provided through standard input. If you want to test the code with sample input, you can replace the line `n = int(input())` with a specific value, such as `n = 10`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
