## Could you solve Baekjoon 11052?

Certainly! Here's the solution to Baekjoon 11052 using dynamic programming:

```python
def max_card_value(prices, n):
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, i + 1):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - j] + prices[j])

    return dp[n]


# Read the input value of N
N = int(input())

# Read the prices of the cards
prices = [0]  # Add a dummy value at index 0
prices += list(map(int, input().split()))

# Calculate and print the maximum card value
max_value = max_card_value(prices, N)
print(max_value)
```

In this solution, we define the function `max_card_value` that takes a list of card prices `prices` and the number of cards `n` as input. It calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by purchasing the cards.

We initialize a DP table `dp` of length `n + 1` with all values set to 0. Each element `dp[i]` represents the maximum value that can be obtained by purchasing cards up to index `i`.

We iterate from 1 to `n` and for each index `i`, we iterate from 1 to `i` to consider all possible combinations of cards. We calculate the maximum value that can be obtained by either not purchasing any card from index `i`, or by purchasing card `j` (where `j` ranges from 1 to `i`) and adding its price to the maximum value obtained from the remaining cards (`dp[i - j]`).

Finally, we return the value of `dp[n]`, which represents the maximum value that can be obtained by purchasing all `n` cards.

We read the input value of `N` from the user, representing the number of cards. Then, we read the prices of the cards and store them in the `prices` list. Note that we add a dummy value at index 0 to align the indices with the card numbers. Finally, we call the `max_card_value` function with the `prices` list and the number of cards `N`, and store the result in the variable `max_value`. Finally, we print the value of `max_value`.

I hope this solves Baekjoon 11052 using dynamic programming. Let me know if you have any further questions!
