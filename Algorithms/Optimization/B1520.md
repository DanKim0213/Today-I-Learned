## Could you solve Baekjoon 1520?

Certainly! Below is the solution to Baekjoon 1520 using dynamic programming:

```python
def dfs(row, col):
    # Check if already visited
    if dp[row][col] != -1:
        return dp[row][col]

    # Base case: if reached the bottom right cell, return 1
    if row == M-1 and col == N-1:
        return 1

    dp[row][col] = 0  # Mark as visited

    # Explore all possible directions (down, up, right, left)
    for d in directions:
        new_row = row + d[0]
        new_col = col + d[1]

        # Check if the new position is within the grid and has a smaller value
        if 0 <= new_row < M and 0 <= new_col < N and heights[new_row][new_col] < heights[row][col]:
            dp[row][col] += dfs(new_row, new_col)

    return dp[row][col]


# Read the input dimensions
M, N = map(int, input().split())

# Read the input heights
heights = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(M)]

# Initialize the memoization table with -1
dp = [[-1] * N for _ in range(M)]

# Directions: down, up, right, left
directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]

# Calculate the number of possible paths using DFS
result = dfs(0, 0)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

In this solution, we use a depth-first search (DFS) approach with memoization. We define the function `dfs` that takes the current position `(row, col)` as parameters. The function recursively explores all possible directions (down, up, right, left) from the current position.

To avoid redundant calculations, we use a memoization table `dp` to store the number of possible paths starting from each position. The memoization table is initialized with -1, indicating that no calculations have been made yet.

In the DFS function, we first check if the current position has already been visited by checking the value in the memoization table. If it has, we return the precalculated value. This helps to avoid recomputing the same position multiple times.

If the current position is the bottom right cell `(M-1, N-1)`, we have reached the destination, and we return 1 to indicate that a valid path has been found.

Otherwise, we mark the current position as visited by setting `dp[row][col]` to 0. Then, we iterate through all possible directions and check if the new position is within the grid boundaries and has a lower height than the current position. If these conditions are met, we recursively call the `dfs` function for the new position and add the returned value to `dp[row][col]`.

Finally, we call the `dfs` function with the starting position `(0, 0)` and store the result in the variable `result`. The value of `result` will be the total number of possible paths from the top left cell to the bottom right cell.

I hope this solves Baekjoon 1520 using dynamic programming and DFS with memoization. Let me know if you have any further questions!
