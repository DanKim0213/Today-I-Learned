## Could you solve Baekjoon 11727?

Certainly! Here's the Python code to solve Baekjoon 11727, which is the "2×n 타일링 2" problem:

```python
def tiling(n):
    dp = [0] * (n + 2)  # Initialize the dynamic programming table
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 3

    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 2 * dp[i - 2]

    return dp[n] % 10007


n = int(input())
result = tiling(n)
print(result)
```

In this code, the `tiling` function implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It takes the input value `n`, which represents the length of the 2×n board, and calculates the number of ways to tile the board with 2×1 and 2×2 tiles.

The function uses a dynamic programming table, `dp`, where each element represents the number of ways to tile the corresponding index `i`. It starts by setting the base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.

Then, it iteratively calculates the number of ways to tile the board using the following recurrence relation:

```
dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 * dp[i-2]
```

The `dp[i-1]` term represents placing a single vertical tile at the end of a (2×i-1) board, while the `2 * dp[i-2]` term represents placing two horizontal tiles at the end of a (2×i-2) board.

The final result is stored in `dp[n]`, representing the number of ways to tile the 2×n board.

The code assumes the input value `n` is provided through standard input. If you want to test the code with sample input, you can replace the line `n = int(input())` with a specific value, such as `n = 4`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
