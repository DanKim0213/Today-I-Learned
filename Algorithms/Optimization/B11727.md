## Could you solve Baekjoon 11727?

Certainly! The problem you mentioned, Baekjoon 11727, is another programming problem from the Baekjoon Online Judge. It asks to calculate the number of ways to tile a 2xN rectangle using 1x2 and 2x2 tiles.

Here's a Python solution for the problem:

```python
def count_tiling_ways(n):
    # Initialize a list to store the count of tiling ways
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)

    # Base cases
    dp[1] = 1
    if n > 1:
        dp[2] = 3

    # Calculate the count of tiling ways for remaining widths
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * dp[i - 2]) % 10007

    # Return the count of tiling ways for width N
    return dp[n]

# Read the input value of N
N = int(input())

# Calculate and print the count of tiling ways
print(count_tiling_ways(N))
```

You can run this code and provide the input value of `N` to get the count of tiling ways for a 2xN rectangle.

In this solution, we use dynamic programming to build a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the count of tiling ways for a 2xi rectangle.

We initialize the base cases as `dp[1] = 1` (when width is 1, there is only one way to tile it with a 1x2 tile) and `dp[2] = 3` (when width is 2, there are three ways: using two 1x2 tiles, one 2x2 tile, or two 2x1 tiles).

Then, we iterate over the remaining widths (from 3 to `n`) and calculate the count of tiling ways for each width. The count for width `i` can be obtained by adding the count for width `i-1` (by adding a vertical 2x1 tile to the right) and twice the count for width `i-2` (by adding two horizontal 1x2 tiles or one 2x2 tile to the right). We use the modulo operator `%` to keep the count within the constraints of the problem (modulo 10007).

Finally, we return the count of tiling ways for the given width `N`.

I hope this helps you solve Baekjoon 11727! Let me know if you have any further questions.
