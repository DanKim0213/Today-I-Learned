## Could you solve Baekjoon 11729?

Certainly! Here's the Python code to solve Baekjoon 11729, which is the "Tower of Hanoi" problem:

```python
def hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, target):
    if n > 0:
        # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary peg
        hanoi(n-1, source, target, auxiliary)

        # Move the nth disk from source to target peg
        print(source, target)

        # Move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to target peg
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, target)


def tower_of_hanoi(n):
    print(2**n - 1)  # Print the total number of moves
    hanoi(n, 1, 2, 3)  # Call the recursive function


n = int(input())
tower_of_hanoi(n)
```

In this code, the `hanoi` function implements the recursive algorithm for the Tower of Hanoi problem. It takes four parameters: `n` (the number of disks), `source` (the source peg), `auxiliary` (the auxiliary peg), and `target` (the target peg). The function moves `n` disks from the source peg to the target peg, using the auxiliary peg.

The `tower_of_hanoi` function takes the input value `n`, which represents the number of disks, and calls the `hanoi` function to solve the problem. It also prints the total number of moves required, which is given by the formula `2^n - 1`.

Please note that the code assumes the input value `n` is provided through standard input. If you want to test the code with sample input, you can replace the line `n = int(input())` with a specific value, such as `n = 3`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
