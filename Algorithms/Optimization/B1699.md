## Could you solve Baekjoon 1699?

Certainly! Here's the solution to Baekjoon 1699 using dynamic programming:

```python
import math

def min_square_sum(n):
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = i  # Initialize dp[i] with the maximum possible value

        # Find the minimum square sum by considering all possible square numbers
        j = 1
        while j * j <= i:
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - j * j] + 1)
            j += 1

    return dp[n]


# Read the input value of n
n = int(input())

# Calculate and print the minimum square sum
min_sum = min_square_sum(n)
print(min_sum)
```

In this solution, we define the function `min_square_sum` that takes an integer `n` as input. It calculates the minimum number of perfect square numbers that sum up to `n`.

We initialize a DP list `dp` of size `n + 1` with all values set to 0. Each element `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of perfect square numbers that sum up to `i`.

We iterate from `i = 1` to `n` and for each `i`, we initialize `dp[i]` with the maximum possible value. Then, we consider all possible square numbers less than or equal to `i` and update `dp[i]` by taking the minimum of the current value of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - j * j] + 1`, where `j` is the square root of the square number being considered.

By doing this, we consider all possible combinations of square numbers and select the one that results in the minimum number of squares.

After completing the iterations, the final value of `dp[n]` will represent the minimum number of perfect square numbers that sum up to `n`. We return this value.

We read the input value of `n` from the user, representing the target number. Then, we call the `min_square_sum` function with `n` as the input, and store the result in the variable `min_sum`. Finally, we print the value of `min_sum`.

I hope this solves Baekjoon 1699 using dynamic programming. Let me know if you have any further questions!
