## Could you solve Baekjoon 2559?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 2559 problem is called "수열" (Sequence). The problem involves finding the maximum sum of a subarray of a given length within a sequence of numbers.

Here's the Python solution for the Baekjoon 2559 problem:

```python
import sys

def max_subarray_sum(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    if k > n:
        return 0

    curr_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    max_sum = curr_sum

    for i in range(k, n):
        curr_sum += arr[i] - arr[i - k]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, curr_sum)

    return max_sum

def main():
    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    temperatures = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))

    result = max_subarray_sum(temperatures, k)
    print(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

To use this solution, you can provide the input values through standard input. The first line should contain two integers separated by a space: `n` (the total number of days) and `k` (the length of the subarray). Then, you need to provide a single line containing `n` integers representing the temperatures of each day.

After running the code, it will output the maximum sum of a subarray of length `k` within the given sequence of temperatures.
