## Could you solve Baekjoon 11659?

Certainly! I'd be happy to help you solve Baekjoon 11659 in Python. This problem is known as "구간 합 구하기 4" (Sum of Intervals 4) on the Baekjoon Online Judge platform. Here's the problem statement for reference:

## Problem Statement (Baekjoon 11659)

Given an array of `N` integers and `M` queries, where each query consists of two indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ `i` ≤ `j` ≤ `N`), you need to compute the sum of the integers within the given range.

## Input

The first line of input contains two integers `N` and `M` (1 ≤ `N`, `M` ≤ 100,000), representing the number of integers and the number of queries, respectively.

The second line of input contains `N` integers separated by a space, which are the elements of the array. Each integer is between -1,000 and 1,000.

Each of the next `M` lines contains two integers `i` and `j` (1 ≤ `i` ≤ `j` ≤ `N`), representing a query.

## Output

Print the sum of the integers within each query on a separate line.

Now, let's write a Python function to solve this problem:

```python
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline


def solve_sum_of_intervals(nums, queries):
    # Create a prefix sum array to store the cumulative sums
    prefix_sum = [0] * (len(nums) + 1)
    for i in range(1, len(nums) + 1):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1]

    # Process each query
    for query in queries:
        i, j = query
        # Compute the sum of the interval using the prefix sum array
        interval_sum = prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i - 1]
        print(interval_sum)
```

Now, you can use this function to solve the problem by providing the array of integers (`nums`) and a list of queries (`queries`) as arguments. Here's an example usage:

```python
N, M = map(int, input().split())
nums = list(map(int, input().split()))

queries = []
for _ in range(M):
    i, j = map(int, input().split())
    queries.append((i, j))

solve_sum_of_intervals(nums, queries)
```

This solution computes the prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of intervals using constant time complexity for each query. It processes each query by subtracting the prefix sum at the starting index from the prefix sum at the ending index. The computed interval sums are then printed as the output.

Please note that this code assumes the input will be provided through standard input (stdin) and the results will be printed to standard output (stdout). You can adjust the I/O operations according to your specific requirements.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
