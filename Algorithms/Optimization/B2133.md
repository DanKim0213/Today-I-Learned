## Could you solve Baekjoon 2133?

Certainly! Baekjoon 2133, also known as the "Tile Decoration" problem, is a dynamic programming problem. The problem statement is as follows:

You want to decorate a wall using 2×1 and 1×2 tiles. The wall has a width of N and a height of 2. You are given that N is a positive even number not exceeding 30.

You want to find the number of ways to decorate the wall using the given tiles.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with the following approach:

1. Initialize an array `dp` of size N+1 and set all elements to 0.
2. Set `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, as there is only one way to decorate a wall of width 0 (by not using any tiles) and three ways to decorate a wall of width 2 (using three 2×1 tiles or one 1×2 tile).
3. Iterate through the even values of i from 4 to N (inclusive).
4. For each i, calculate `dp[i]` using the recurrence relation: `dp[i] = 3 * dp[i-2] + 2 * (dp[i-4] + dp[i-6] + ... + dp[0])`.
   - The term `3 * dp[i-2]` represents the case where a 2×1 tile is placed horizontally at the end, which accounts for three possible configurations.
   - The term `2 * (dp[i-4] + dp[i-6] + ... + dp[0])` represents the case where a 1×2 tile is placed vertically at the end. Since the width of the tile is 2, we need to consider the sum of configurations for the remaining width.
5. After the iteration, the value of `dp[N]` will represent the number of ways to decorate the wall of width N.
6. Return `dp[N]` as the result.

Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def tileDecoration(N):
    if N % 2 == 1:  # N is odd
        return 0

    dp = [0] * (N + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    dp[2] = 3

    for i in range(4, N + 1, 2):
        dp[i] = 3 * dp[i - 2]
        for j in range(4, i + 1, 2):
            dp[i] += 2 * dp[i - j]

    return dp[N]

# Example usage
N = 8
result = tileDecoration(N)
print(result)
```

For the given example of N = 8, the output will be `153`. This means there are 153 different ways to decorate a wall of width 8 using the given tiles.

Note that the code assumes N is a positive even number not exceeding 30, as stated in the problem description.
