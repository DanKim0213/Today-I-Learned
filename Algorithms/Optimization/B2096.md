## Could you solve Baekjoon 2096?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 2096 problem is called "내려가기" (Downhill). The problem involves finding the maximum and minimum total scores when moving from the top row to the bottom row of a grid, following specific rules.

Here's the Python solution for the Baekjoon 2096 problem:

```python
import sys

def find_max_min_scores(grid, n):
    dp_max = [0] * 3
    dp_min = [0] * 3

    for row in grid:
        new_dp_max = [0] * 3
        new_dp_min = [0] * 3

        new_dp_max[0] = max(dp_max[0], dp_max[1]) + row[0]
        new_dp_max[1] = max(dp_max[0], dp_max[1], dp_max[2]) + row[1]
        new_dp_max[2] = max(dp_max[1], dp_max[2]) + row[2]

        new_dp_min[0] = min(dp_min[0], dp_min[1]) + row[0]
        new_dp_min[1] = min(dp_min[0], dp_min[1], dp_min[2]) + row[1]
        new_dp_min[2] = min(dp_min[1], dp_min[2]) + row[2]

        dp_max = new_dp_max
        dp_min = new_dp_min

    max_score = max(dp_max)
    min_score = min(dp_min)

    return max_score, min_score

def main():
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    grid = []
    for _ in range(n):
        row = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        grid.append(row)

    max_score, min_score = find_max_min_scores(grid, n)
    print(max_score, min_score)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

To use this solution, you can provide the input values through standard input. The first line should contain an integer `n` (the number of rows in the grid). Then, you need to provide `n` lines, each containing three integers representing the values in each row of the grid.

After running the code, it will output the maximum and minimum total scores when moving from the top row to the bottom row of the grid, following the given rules.

## Optimal Substructure and Overlapping Subproblems

### Optimal Substrcuture

`dp_max` and `dp_min` represent not what we will chose, but what we choose. And therefore they have optimal substructures. 

### Overlapping Subproblmes

`new_dp_max` and `new_dp_min` represent max val of  the previous `dp_max` and `dp_min` plus the current val.
