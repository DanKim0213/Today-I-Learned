## Could you solve Baekjoon 2011?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 2011 problem is known as "암호코드" (Cryptographic Code). Here's the Python code to solve it:

```python
def count_decodings(code):
    n = len(code)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)  # DP table to store the number of decodings

    # Base cases
    dp[0] = 1
    dp[1] = 1 if code[0] != '0' else 0

    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # Check if the current digit can be combined with the previous digit
        if code[i - 1] != '0':
            dp[i] += dp[i - 1]

        two_digit = int(code[i - 2:i])
        # Check if the current two digits can form a valid number
        if 10 <= two_digit <= 26:
            dp[i] += dp[i - 2]

    return dp[n] % 1000000


# Read input value
code = input()

# Calculate and print the result
result = count_decodings(code)
print(result)
```

In this solution, we use dynamic programming to count the number of possible decodings of the given code. Here's how the code works:

- The `count_decodings` function takes a string `code` as input and returns the number of possible decodings.
- We initialize a dynamic programming table `dp` with zeros to store the number of decodings at each position.
- We set the base cases:
  - `dp[0]` is set to 1 because there is one way to decode an empty string.
  - `dp[1]` is set to 1 if the first digit of the code is not zero, indicating a valid decoding. Otherwise, it is set to 0.
- We iterate from the third digit to the end of the code:
  - For each digit, we check if it can be combined with the previous digit to form a valid number (i.e., the current digit is not zero).
  - If it can be combined, we add the number of decodings at the previous position to the current position.
  - We also check if the current two digits can form a valid number (between 10 and 26, inclusive).
  - If they can, we add the number of decodings two positions back to the current position.
- Finally, we return the number of decodings at the last position (`dp[n]`), modulo 1000000.

In the main part of the code:

- We read the input value `code`, which represents the encoded message.
- We call the `count_decodings` function with the input value to calculate the number of possible decodings.
- We print the result.

The code assumes the input is read from standard input. The input consists of a single line containing the encoded message represented as a string of digits. You may need to modify the code if your input format differs.

Please note that this solution assumes the input code is a valid encoding and does not contain any characters other than digits.
