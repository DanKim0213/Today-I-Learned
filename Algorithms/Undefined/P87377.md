```python
min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y = -float("inf"), -float("inf"), float("inf"), float("inf")

## What I learned 

- How to convert Grid to xy coordinates
- How to check type 

### How to convert Grid to xy coordinates

First of all, we initially store values on Grid because it fits into Array type. Note that the point of Grid, (0, 0), is the very up-left corner of xy coordinates. 

In xy coordinates, numbers are growing as far as going to the right and upward. On the other hand, in grid, numbers are growing as far as going to the right and downward. Therefore, to convert grid to xy coordinates, we should **change the up-down direction reversely**.

```

# xy coordinates

  789
^ 456
| 123
->

# Grid ()

| 123
V 456
  789
->

```

### How to check int type

```python

x = a/b
if x == int(x):
    return "Yes, it is"
if x.is_integer():
    return "Yes, It is"

```
