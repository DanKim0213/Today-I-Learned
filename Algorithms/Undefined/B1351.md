## Could you solve Baekjoon 1351?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 1351 problem is known as "무한 수열" (Infinite Sequence). Here's the Python code to solve it:

```python
def calculate(n, p, q, memo):
    if n == 0:
        return 1

    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]

    memo[n] = calculate(n // p, p, q, memo) + calculate(n // q, p, q, memo)
    return memo[n]


# Read input values
n, p, q = map(int, input().split())

# Initialize a memoization dictionary
memo = {}

# Calculate and print the result
result = calculate(n, p, q, memo)
print(result)
```

In this solution, we use a recursive approach with memoization to calculate the value of the infinite sequence. Here's how the code works:

- The `calculate` function takes four parameters: `n` (the current index), `p` (the first number), `q` (the second number), and `memo` (a dictionary to store computed values for memoization).
- If the current index `n` is 0, we return 1 because the sequence starts with 1.
- If the value for the current index `n` is already stored in the memoization dictionary, we return the precalculated value.
- Otherwise, we recursively calculate the value by dividing `n` by `p` and `q` and summing the results of the recursive calls. We store the result in the memoization dictionary for future use.
- Finally, we return the calculated value.

In the main part of the code:

- We read the input values `n`, `p`, and `q`.
- We initialize a memoization dictionary called `memo` to store the calculated values.
- We call the `calculate` function with the input values and the memoization dictionary to calculate the result.
- We print the result.

The code assumes the input is read from standard input. The first line contains the values of `n`, `p`, and `q`. You may need to modify the code if your input format differs.

Using memoization helps avoid redundant calculations and improves the efficiency of the solution. It allows us to efficiently compute the values for large indices of the sequence.

## What I learned 

### KeyError occurs:

```python
if memo[3]: print(memo[3])
```

The solutions are:
```python

# 1. check if the key is in the dictionary (recommended)
memo = dict()
if 3 in memo:
    print(memo[3])

# 2. initialize to a default value using defaultdict
memo = defaultdict(int)
print(memo[3])

# 3. check if the key is not `None`
memo = dict()
if meme.get(3):
    print(memo.get(3))

```

Example:
```python

from collections import defaultdict


def calculate(n, p, q, memo):
    if memo[n] != 0:
        return memo[n]

    memo[n] = calculate(n // p, p, q, memo) + calculate(n // q, p, q, memo)
    return memo[n]


n, p, q = map(int, input().split())

memo = defaultdict(int) # The default value is `0`
memo[0] = 1

result = calculate(n, p, q, memo)
print(result)

```

### Memory limit exceeds

It is because N ranges up to 10^12. Thus, it is ridiculous to try tabulation. Instead, dictionary (a.k.a. Map) is good to go.
