## Could you solve Baekjoon 11049?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 11049 problem is known as "행렬 곱셈 순서" (Matrix Multiplication Order). Here's the Python code to solve it using dynamic programming:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline


def matrix_multiplication_order(matrices):
    n = len(matrices)
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

    for gap in range(1, n):
        for i in range(n - gap):
            j = i + gap
            dp[i][j] = float("inf")
            for k in range(i, j):
                dp[i][j] = min(
                    dp[i][j],
                    dp[i][k]
                    + dp[k + 1][j]
                    + matrices[i][0] * matrices[k][1] * matrices[j][1],
                )

    return dp[0][n - 1]


# Read input values
n = int(input())
matrices = []

for _ in range(n):
    r, c = map(int, input().split())
    matrices.append((r, c))

# Calculate and print the result
result = matrix_multiplication_order(matrices)
print(result)
```

In this solution, we use dynamic programming to find the minimum number of scalar multiplications required to multiply a chain of matrices. Here's how the code works:

- The `matrix_multiplication_order` function takes a list of matrices as input and returns the minimum number of scalar multiplications required.
- We initialize a dynamic programming table `dp` with dimensions `(n × n)`, where `n` is the number of matrices.
- We iterate through the `gap` from 1 to `n - 1`, representing the length of the chain of matrices being multiplied.
- For each gap length, we iterate through all possible starting points `i` in the chain.
- We calculate the endpoint `j` based on the current `gap` and `i`.
- We initialize the minimum number of scalar multiplications for the current `i` and `j` as infinity.
- For each possible `k` value between `i` and `j - 1`, we calculate the number of scalar multiplications for multiplying the matrices from `i` to `k` and from `k + 1` to `j`.
- We update the minimum number of scalar multiplications for the current `i` and `j` as the minimum of the previous value and the new value calculated using the formula `(dp[i][k] + dp[k + 1][j] + matrices[i][0] * matrices[k][1] * matrices[j][1])`.
- After completing the iterations, the minimum number of scalar multiplications required to multiply the entire chain of matrices will be stored in `dp[0][n - 1]`.
- We return this value as the result.

In the main part of the code:

- We read the input value `n`, representing the number of matrices.
- We iterate `n` times to read the dimensions of each matrix and add them to the `matrices` list as tuples `(r, c)` representing the rows and columns of each matrix.
- We call the `matrix_multiplication_order` function with the `matrices` list to calculate the minimum number of scalar multiplications required.
- We print the result.

The code assumes the input is read from standard input. The first line contains the value of `n`. The following `n` lines contain two integers `r` and `c`, representing the dimensions of the matrices. You may need to modify the code if your input format differs.

Please note that this solution assumes the dimensions of the matrices are valid for multiplication, and the order of multiplication is associative.
