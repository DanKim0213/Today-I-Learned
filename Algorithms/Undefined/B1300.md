## Could you solve Baekjoon 1300?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 1300 problem is known as "K번째 수" (Kth Number). It involves finding the Kth smallest number in a matrix where each element is the product of its row and column indices. Here's the Python code to solve it using binary search:

```python
def count_smaller_or_equal(n, x):
    count = 0

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # The count per row is `n` if x // i is out of boundary `n`
        count += min(x // i, n)  

    return count


def find_kth_smallest(n, k):
    low = 1
    high = k

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2

        count = count_smaller_or_equal(n, mid)

        if count >= k:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            low = mid + 1

    return result


# Read input values
n = int(input())
k = int(input())

# Calculate and print the result
result = find_kth_smallest(n, k)
print(result)
```

In this solution, we use binary search to find the Kth smallest number in the matrix. Here's how the code works:

- The `count_smaller_or_equal` function takes the size of the matrix `n` and a number `x` as input. It counts the number of elements in the matrix that are smaller than or equal to `x`. It does this by iterating over each row and calculating the number of elements in that row that are smaller than or equal to `x`. The minimum between `x // i` and `n` represents the number of elements in that row that are smaller than or equal to `x`. The function returns the total count.
- The `find_kth_smallest` function takes the size of the matrix `n` and the value of `k` as input. It performs binary search to find the Kth smallest number in the matrix. The search range is initially set from 1 to `k`. In each iteration, the middle value `mid` of the range is calculated, and the number of elements smaller than or equal to `mid` is counted using the `count_smaller_or_equal` function. If the count is greater than or equal to `k`, it means the Kth smallest number lies within the lower half of the range, so the upper bound `high` is updated. Otherwise, the Kth smallest number lies within the upper half of the range, so the lower bound `low` is updated. The search continues until `low` becomes greater than `high`, at which point the Kth smallest number is found.
- In the main part of the code:
  - We read the input values `n` and `k`, representing the size of the matrix and the value of `k`.
  - We call the `find_kth_smallest` function with `n` and `k` to calculate the Kth smallest number.
  - We print the result.

The code assumes the input is read from standard input. The first line contains the value of `n`, representing the size of the matrix. The second line contains the value of `k`. You may need to modify the code if your input format differs.

Please note that this solution assumes the value of `n` is positive and `k` is within the valid range.

## What makes me confused with this problem?

```
3
7

output: 6

if x is 6, the count is 8. 
1 2 3 - count 3
2 4 6 - count 3
3 6 9 - count 2

However, if x is. , the count is 6.
1 2 3 - count 3
2 4 6 - count 2
3 6 9 - count 1
```
