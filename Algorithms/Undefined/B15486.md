## Could you solve Baekjoon 15486?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 15486 problem is known as "퇴사 2" (Retirement 2). Here's the Python code to solve it:

```python
def max_profit(n, schedules):
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)  # DP table to store the maximum profit at each day

    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        next_day = i + schedules[i][0]  # Next day to work after current day

        if next_day <= n:
            dp[i] = max(schedules[i][1] + dp[next_day], dp[i + 1])
        else:
            dp[i] = dp[i + 1]

    return dp[0]


# Read input values
n = int(input())
schedules = []

for _ in range(n):
    t, p = map(int, input().split())
    schedules.append((t, p))

# Calculate and print the maximum profit
result = max_profit(n, schedules)
print(result)
```

In this solution, we use dynamic programming to find the maximum profit that can be obtained by choosing the optimal schedule. Here's how the code works:

- The `max_profit` function takes the number of days `n` and the schedules as input and returns the maximum profit.
- We initialize a dynamic programming table `dp` with zeros to store the maximum profit at each day.
- We iterate from the last day to the first day (in reverse order).
- For each day, we calculate the next day to work after the current day (`next_day`) based on the duration of the current job.
- If the `next_day` is within the range of the total number of days `n`, we can choose to work on that day. We calculate the maximum profit by considering the profit of working on the current day (`schedules[i][1]`) plus the maximum profit on the `next_day` (`dp[next_day]`). Otherwise, we cannot work on the `next_day`, so the maximum profit remains the same as the next day (`dp[i + 1]`).
- We update the dynamic programming table `dp` with the maximum profit for the current day.
- After iterating through all the days, the maximum profit will be stored in `dp[0]`, which represents the maximum profit on the first day.
- We return the maximum profit as the result.

The code assumes the input is read from standard input. The first line contains the value of `n`, representing the number of days. The following `n` lines represent the schedules, where each line contains two integers `t` and `p`, representing the duration of the job and the corresponding profit. You may need to modify the code if your input format differs.
