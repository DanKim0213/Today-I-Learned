## Could you solve Baekjoon 1918?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 1918 problem is known as "후위 표기식" (Postfix Expression). It involves converting an infix expression to a postfix expression. Here's the Python code to solve it:

```python
def infix_to_postfix(expression):
    # Operator precedence dictionary
    precedence = {'+': 1, '-': 1, '*': 2, '/': 2, '(': 0}

    postfix = []
    stack = []

    for char in expression:
        if char.isalpha():
            postfix.append(char)
        elif char == '(':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ')':
            while stack and stack[-1] != '(':
                postfix.append(stack.pop())
            stack.pop()
        else:
            while stack and precedence[char] <= precedence.get(stack[-1], 0):
                postfix.append(stack.pop())
            stack.append(char)

    while stack:
        postfix.append(stack.pop())

    return ''.join(postfix)


# Read input value
expression = input()

# Convert the infix expression to postfix
postfix_expression = infix_to_postfix(expression)

# Print the postfix expression
print(postfix_expression)
```

In this solution, we use a stack to convert the infix expression to postfix. Here's how the code works:

- The `infix_to_postfix` function takes the infix expression as input and converts it to a postfix expression.
- We define a dictionary `precedence` that maps each operator to its precedence level.
- We initialize an empty list `postfix` to store the postfix expression and a stack `stack` to store the operators.
- We iterate through each character in the infix expression.
  - If the character is an alphabet character (operand), we append it to the `postfix` list.
  - If the character is an opening parenthesis, we push it onto the stack.
  - If the character is a closing parenthesis, we pop operators from the stack and append them to the `postfix` list until we encounter the opening parenthesis. Then, we discard the opening parenthesis.
  - If the character is an operator, we compare its precedence with the operator at the top of the stack. If the precedence is higher or equal, we pop the top operator from the stack and append it to the `postfix` list. We repeat this process until the stack is empty or the operator at the top of the stack has lower precedence. Finally, we push the current operator onto the stack.
- After processing all characters, we pop any remaining operators from the stack and append them to the `postfix` list.
- We join the elements of the `postfix` list into a string and return the resulting postfix expression.
- In the main part of the code:
  - We read the input value `expression`, representing the infix expression.
  - We call the `infix_to_postfix` function with the `expression` to convert it to a postfix expression.
  - We print the postfix expression.

The code assumes the input is read from standard input. The input consists of a single line containing the infix expression. You may need to modify the code if your input format differs.

Please note that this solution assumes the input infix expression is valid and follows the problem constraints.
