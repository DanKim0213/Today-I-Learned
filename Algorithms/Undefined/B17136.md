## Could you solve Baekjoon 17136?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 17136 problem is known as "색종이 붙이기" (Paper Attach). It involves finding the minimum number of colored papers needed to cover a given grid. Here's the Python code to solve it using backtracking:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline


def is_valid(board, row, col, size):
    # Check if the paper exceeds the boundaries of the board
    if row + size > 10 or col + size > 10:
        return False

    # Check if the cells are already covered by other papers
    for i in range(row, row + size):
        for j in range(col, col + size):
            if board[i][j] == 0:
                return False

    return True


def cover_board(board, papers, count):
    global min_count

    # If the current count is already greater than the minimum count, no need to proceed
    if count >= min_count:
        return

    # Find the next empty cell
    row, col = -1, -1
    for i in range(10):
        for j in range(10):
            if board[i][j] == 1:
                row, col = i, j
                break
        if row != -1:
            break

    # If all cells are covered, update the minimum count
    if row == -1:
        min_count = min(min_count, count)
        return

    # Try to cover the board with different sizes of papers
    for size in range(1, 6):
        if papers[size] > 0 and is_valid(board, row, col, size):
            # Cover the cells with the paper
            for i in range(row, row + size):
                for j in range(col, col + size):
                    board[i][j] = 0

            # Decrease the count of available papers of that size
            papers[size] -= 1

            # Recursively cover the remaining board
            cover_board(board, papers, count + 1)

            # Restore the covered cells and the count of available papers
            for i in range(row, row + size):
                for j in range(col, col + size):
                    board[i][j] = 1

            papers[size] += 1


# Read input values
board = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(10)]

# Count the number of ones (uncolored cells)
total_count = sum(row.count(1) for row in board)

# Initialize the count of the minimum number of papers
min_count = float("inf")

# Initialize the count of available papers of each size
papers = [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

# Solve the problem
cover_board(board, papers, 0)

# Print the result (-1 if it's impossible to cover the board)
result = min_count if min_count != float("inf") else -1
print(result)
```

In this solution, we use backtracking to find the minimum number of colored papers needed to cover the board. Here's how the code works:

- The `is_valid` function takes the current board, the top-left cell `(row, col)` of the paper, and the size of the paper. It checks if the paper can be placed in the given position on the board. It verifies that the paper does not exceed the boundaries of the board and that all the cells to be covered are empty (i.e., have a value of 1).
- The `cover_board` function takes the current board, the count of available papers of each size, and the current count of used papers. It recursively covers the board using different sizes of papers and updates the minimum count of papers accordingly.
- The function first finds the next empty cell in the board. If all cells are covered, it updates the minimum count if the current count is smaller.
- If there is an empty cell, the function tries to cover the board with different sizes of papers. It checks if the paper of the current size is available and if it can be placed in the current position using the `is_valid` function. If so, it covers the cells with the paper, decreases the count of available papers, and recursively calls the `cover_board` function for the remaining board.
- After the recursive call, it restores the covered cells and increases the count of available papers to backtrack and explore other possibilities.
- In the main part of the code:
  - We read the input values for the board. Each line contains 10 space-separated integers representing a row of the board.
  - We count the number of ones (uncolored cells) in the board using the `sum` function and list comprehension.
  - We initialize the minimum count of papers to a large value (`float('inf')`) and the count of available papers of each size.
  - We call the `cover_board` function with the board, the count of available papers, and an initial count of 0 to find the minimum number of papers needed to cover the board.
  - We print the result (-1 if it's impossible to cover the board).

The code assumes the input is read from standard input. The input consists of 10 lines, each containing 10 space-separated integers representing the cells of the board. You may need to modify the code if your input format differs.

Please note that this solution assumes the input values follow the problem constraints, such as having exactly 10 lines and 10 integers per line.
