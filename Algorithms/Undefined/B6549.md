## Could you solve Baekjoon 6549?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 6549 problem is known as "히스토그램에서 가장 큰 직사각형" (Largest Rectangle in a Histogram). It involves finding the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed from a given histogram. Here's the Python code to solve it using a stack:

```python
def largest_rectangle(histogram):
    stack = []
    max_area = 0
    n = len(histogram)

    for i in range(n):
        while stack and histogram[stack[-1]] > histogram[i]:
            height = histogram[stack.pop()]
            width = i if not stack else i - stack[-1] - 1
            max_area = max(max_area, height * width)

        stack.append(i)

    while stack:
        height = histogram[stack.pop()]
        width = n if not stack else n - stack[-1] - 1
        max_area = max(max_area, height * width)

    return max_area


# Read input values
while True:
    histogram = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Break the loop if the input is 0
    if histogram[0] == 0:
        break

    # Calculate and print the result
    result = largest_rectangle(histogram[1:])
    print(result)
```

In this solution, we use a stack to find the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram. Here's how the code works:

- The `largest_rectangle` function takes the histogram as input and returns the area of the largest rectangle.
- We initialize an empty stack, `stack`, to store the indices of the histogram bars.
- We initialize `max_area` to 0 to keep track of the maximum area.
- We iterate through the histogram bars.
  - While the stack is not empty and the height of the bar at the top of the stack is greater than the current bar, we pop the index from the stack and calculate the area of the rectangle formed by the popped bar.
  - The height of the rectangle is the height of the popped bar, and the width is calculated as the current index `i` if the stack is empty (indicating that the popped bar is the smallest bar seen so far), or `i - stack[-1] - 1` if the stack is not empty.
  - We update `max_area` with the maximum of the current `max_area` and the area of the rectangle.
  - We push the current index `i` onto the stack.
- After processing all bars, there might be remaining bars in the stack. We handle them similarly to the previous loop, but this time the width is calculated differently since there are no more bars to the right.
- We return the maximum area found.
- In the main part of the code:
  - We repeatedly read the input values for the histogram until the input is 0.
  - We call the `largest_rectangle` function with the histogram values and print the result.

The code assumes the input is read from standard input. The input consists of one or more lines, each containing the histogram bars separated by spaces. Each line represents a separate histogram, and the input is terminated by a line containing only a single 0. You may need to modify the code if your input format differs.

Please note that this solution assumes the histogram values are positive and the input format follows the problem constraints.
