## Could you solve Baekjoon 1525?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 1525 problem is known as "퍼즐" (Sliding Puzzle). It involves finding the minimum number of moves to solve a 3x3 sliding puzzle. Here's the Python code to solve it using breadth-first search (BFS):

```python
from collections import deque
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline


def get_new_board(board, x1, y1, x2, y2):
    new_board = [row[:] for row in board]  # Create a copy of the board

    # Swap the positions of the two tiles
    new_board[x1][y1], new_board[x2][y2] = new_board[x2][y2], new_board[x1][y1]

    return new_board


def board_to_string(board):
    return "".join(str(num) for row in board for num in row)


def string_to_board(s):
    board = [[0] * 3 for _ in range(3)]
    idx = 0

    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            board[i][j] = int(s[idx])
            idx += 1

    return board


def bfs(start_board):
    target = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 0]]  # Target board configuration

    queue = deque([(start_board, 0)])
    visited = set()

    while queue:
        current_board, moves = queue.popleft()

        if current_board == target:
            return moves

        zero_x, zero_y = find_zero_position(current_board)

        # Generate all possible moves from the current position of the zero tile
        for dx, dy in [(0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (1, 0)]:
            new_x, new_y = zero_x + dx, zero_y + dy

            if 0 <= new_x < 3 and 0 <= new_y < 3:
                new_board = get_new_board(current_board, zero_x, zero_y, new_x, new_y)
                new_board_string = board_to_string(new_board)

                if new_board_string not in visited:
                    visited.add(new_board_string)
                    queue.append((new_board, moves + 1))

    return -1


def find_zero_position(board):
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            if board[i][j] == 0:
                return i, j


# Read input values
start_board = []
for _ in range(3):
    row = list(map(int, input().split()))
    start_board.append(row)

# Calculate and print the result
result = bfs(start_board)
print(result)
```

In this solution, we use breadth-first search (BFS) to find the minimum number of moves to solve the sliding puzzle. Here's how the code works:

- The `get_new_board` function takes the current board, the positions `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` of the two tiles to swap, and returns a new board configuration with the tiles swapped.
- The `board_to_string` function takes a board configuration and converts it into a string representation.
- The `string_to_board` function takes a string representation of a board and converts it back into a board configuration.
- The `bfs` function performs a breadth-first search starting from the given `start_board` configuration. It uses a queue to keep track of the current board configuration and the number of moves taken. It also uses a set to store the visited configurations to avoid revisiting the same configuration.
- We start the search with the `start_board` and 0 moves.
- While the queue is not empty, we dequeue a board configuration and the number of moves taken.
- If the current board configuration matches the target configuration, we return the number of moves taken.
- Otherwise, we find the position of the zero tile (represented by 0) on the board.
- We generate all possible moves by swapping the position of the zero tile with one of its neighboring tiles.
- For each valid move, we create a new board configuration by swapping the tiles, convert it into a string representation, and check if it has been visited before. If it hasn't, we add it to the visited set and enqueue the new board configuration along with the number of moves taken plus one.
- If no solution is found, we return -1.
- In the main part of the code:
  - We read the input values for the `start_board` configuration. Each line contains three space-separated integers representing a row of the board.
  - We call the `bfs` function with the `start_board` configuration to calculate the minimum number of moves to solve the sliding puzzle.
  - We print the result.

The code assumes the input is read from standard input. The input should consist of three lines, each containing three space-separated integers representing the board configuration. The numbers should range from 0 to 8, where 0 represents the empty tile. You may need to modify the code if your input format differs.

Please note that this solution assumes there is a valid solution to the sliding puzzle and the input configuration is valid according to the problem constraints.
