## Could you solve Baekjoon 1107?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 1107 problem is known as "리모컨" (Remote Control). Here's the Python code to solve it:

```python
def check_possible(channel, broken_buttons):
    if channel == 0:
        if 0 in broken_buttons:
            return False
        else:
            return True

    while channel > 0:
        digit = channel % 10
        if digit in broken_buttons:
            return False
        channel //= 10

    return True


# Read input values
target_channel = int(input())
n = int(input())
broken_buttons = set(map(int, input().split()))

# Initialize the minimum number of button presses
min_presses = abs(target_channel - 100)

# Check all possible channels within the range
for channel in range(1000001):
    if check_possible(channel, broken_buttons):
        min_presses = min(min_presses, len(str(channel)) + abs(channel - target_channel))

# Print the minimum number of button presses
print(min_presses)
```

In this solution, we iterate through all possible channels within the range and check if each channel can be reached using the available buttons. Here's how the code works:

- The `check_possible` function checks if a channel can be reached by pressing the buttons on the remote control. It takes the channel number and a set of broken buttons as input and returns `True` if it is possible to reach the channel, and `False` otherwise.
- We read the input values: `target_channel` (the desired channel), `n` (the number of broken buttons), and the set of `broken_buttons`.
- We initialize the minimum number of button presses as the absolute difference between the target channel and the default channel 100 (the initial position of the remote).
- We iterate through all possible channels within the range (0 to 1,000,000).
- For each channel, we check if it is possible to reach the channel by calling the `check_possible` function. If it is possible, we calculate the number of button presses required to reach the channel and update the `min_presses` variable if necessary.
- Finally, we print the minimum number of button presses required to reach the target channel.

The code assumes the input is read from standard input. The first line contains the value of the `target_channel`. The second line contains the value of `n`. The third line contains `n` integers representing the broken buttons. You may need to modify the code if your input format differs.

Please note that this solution may not be the most optimal for larger input ranges, as it iterates through all possible channels. However, it provides a straightforward approach to solve the problem within the given constraints.
