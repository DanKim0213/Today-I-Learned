## Could you solve Baekjoon 1194?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 1194 problem is known as "달이 차오른다, 가자." It involves finding the minimum number of moves to reach a destination in a maze. Here's the Python code to solve it using breadth-first search (BFS):

```python
from collections import deque
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

# Possible moves: up, down, left, right
dx = [-1, 1, 0, 0]
dy = [0, 0, -1, 1]


def is_valid_move(n, m, x, y):
    return 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < m


def bfs(start_x, start_y, maze, keys, n, m):
    queue = deque([(start_x, start_y, 0, 0)])  # (x, y, steps, key bitmask)
    visited = [[[-1] * (1 << 6) for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]

    visited[start_x][start_y][0] = 0

    while queue:
        x, y, steps, key_mask = queue.popleft()

        # Reached the destination
        if maze[x][y] == "1":
            return steps

        for i in range(4):
            nx = x + dx[i]
            ny = y + dy[i]

            if (
                is_valid_move(n, m, nx, ny)
                and visited[nx][ny][key_mask] == -1
                and maze[nx][ny] != "#"
            ):
                # Reached a key
                if "a" <= maze[nx][ny] <= "f":
                    new_key_mask = key_mask | (1 << (ord(maze[nx][ny]) - ord("a")))
                    visited[nx][ny][new_key_mask] = steps + 1
                    queue.append((nx, ny, steps + 1, new_key_mask))
                # Encountered a door
                elif "A" <= maze[nx][ny] <= "F":
                    door_key = 1 << (ord(maze[nx][ny]) - ord("A"))
                    if key_mask & door_key:
                        visited[nx][ny][key_mask] = steps + 1
                        queue.append((nx, ny, steps + 1, key_mask))
                # Regular move
                else:
                    visited[nx][ny][key_mask] = steps + 1
                    queue.append((nx, ny, steps + 1, key_mask))

    return -1


# Read input values
n, m = map(int, input().split())

maze = []
start_x, start_y = -1, -1

for i in range(n):
    row = list(input())
    maze.append(row)
    if "0" in row:
        start_x, start_y = i, row.index("0")

# Calculate the minimum number of moves
result = bfs(start_x, start_y, maze, set(), n, m)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

In this solution, we use breadth-first search (BFS) to find the minimum number of moves to reach the destination in the maze. Here's how the code works:

- We define a list of possible moves in the `dx` and `dy` arrays: up, down, left, and right.
- The `is_valid_move` function checks if a move `(x, y)` is valid within the maze boundaries.
- The `bfs` function performs a breadth-first search starting from the given `(start_x, start_y)` position in the maze. It keeps track of the number of steps taken and the keys obtained using a bitmask. It returns the minimum number of steps to reach the destination.
- We use a queue to store the positions `(x, y)`, the number of steps taken, and the bitmask of the obtained keys. We initialize the queue with the starting position `(start_x, start_y)` and the initial steps and key bitmask values.
- We use a visited matrix `visited` to keep track of the visited positions for each key bitmask.
- While the queue is not empty, we dequeue a position `(x, y)` along with the number of steps taken and the key bitmask.
- If the current position is the destination `'1'`, we return the number of steps taken.
- We iterate through the four possible moves from the current position and check if the move is valid and has not been visited before. If the move leads to a key, we update the key bitmask. If the move encounters a door and the key to open it is present in the bitmask, we continue the move. Otherwise, we update the visited matrix and enqueue the new position along with the updated steps and key bitmask.
- If no path is found, we return `-1`.
- In the main part of the code:
  - We read the input values `n` and `m`, representing the dimensions of the maze.
  - We read the maze configuration and store it in the `maze` list. We also find the starting position `(start_x, start_y)` marked as `'0'`.
  - We call the `bfs` function with the starting position, maze, an empty set of keys, and the dimensions of the maze to calculate the minimum number of moves.
  - We print the result.

The code assumes the input is read from standard input. The first line contains the values of `n` and `m`. The following `n` lines represent the maze configuration, where each line contains `m` characters representing the cells in the maze. You may need to modify the code if your input format differs.

Please note that this solution assumes there is exactly one starting position `'0'` and one destination position `'1'` in the maze, and the maze is valid according to the problem constraints.
