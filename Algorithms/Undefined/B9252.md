## Could you solve Baekjoon 9252?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 9252 problem is known as "LCS 2" (Longest Common Subsequence 2). Here's the Python code to solve it:

```python
def lcs(s1, s2):
    n, m = len(s1), len(s2)
    dp = [[""] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            if s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + s1[i - 1]
            else:
                if len(dp[i - 1][j]) > len(dp[i][j - 1]):
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]

    return dp[n][m]


# Read input values
s1 = input()
s2 = input()

# Calculate and print the result
result = lcs(s1, s2)
length = len(result)
print(length)
print(result)
```

In this solution, we use dynamic programming to find the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two strings. Here's how the code works:

- The `lcs` function takes two strings `s1` and `s2` as input and returns the longest common subsequence.
- We initialize a 2D dynamic programming table `dp` with dimensions `(n + 1) Ã— (m + 1)`, where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `s1` and `s2` respectively.
- We iterate through the characters of `s1` and `s2` using two nested loops.
- For each pair of characters, if they are equal, we append the character to the LCS computed so far by taking the LCS of the previous characters (`dp[i - 1][j - 1]`) and adding the current character.
- If the characters are not equal, we choose the longer LCS between the LCS of the previous character in `s1` and the current character in `s2` (`dp[i - 1][j]`) and the LCS of the previous character in `s2` and the current character in `s1` (`dp[i][j - 1]`).
- After completing the iterations, the LCS will be stored in `dp[n][m]`.
- We return the LCS as the result of the `lcs` function.

In the main part of the code:

- We read the input values `s1` and `s2`, representing the two strings.
- We call the `lcs` function with the input values to calculate the LCS.
- We calculate the length of the LCS and store it in the `length` variable.
- We print the `length` and the LCS itself as the result.

The code assumes the input is read from standard input. The first line contains the string `s1`, and the second line contains the string `s2`. You may need to modify the code if your input format differs.

Please note that this solution assumes the input strings are non-empty.
