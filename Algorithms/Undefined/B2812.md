## Could you solve Baekjoon 2812?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 2812 problem is known as "크게 만들기" (Make it Bigger). Here's the Python code to solve it:

```python
def make_bigger(n, k, number):
    stack = []

    for digit in number:
        while k > 0 and stack and stack[-1] < digit:
            stack.pop()
            k -= 1
        stack.append(digit)

    # If k is still greater than 0, remove the remaining digits from the end
    while k > 0:
        stack.pop()
        k -= 1

    return "".join(stack)


# Read input values
n, k = map(int, input().split())
number = input()

# Calculate and print the result
result = make_bigger(n, k, number)
print(result)
```

In this solution, we use a stack to construct the maximum number by removing digits. Here's how the code works:

- The `make_bigger` function takes the length of the number `n`, the number of digits to be removed `k`, and the number itself as input. It returns the maximum number that can be obtained.
- We initialize an empty stack to store the digits.
- We iterate through each digit in the number:
  - While `k` is greater than 0, the stack is not empty, and the last digit in the stack is smaller than the current digit, we remove the last digit from the stack and decrement `k`.
  - After the above step, we push the current digit to the stack.
- If `k` is still greater than 0, it means there are remaining digits to be removed. We remove them from the end of the stack.
- Finally, we join the digits in the stack to form the maximum number and return it.

In the main part of the code:

- We read the input values `n` (the length of the number), `k` (the number of digits to be removed), and `number` (the number itself).
- We call the `make_bigger` function with the input values to calculate the maximum number that can be obtained.
- We print the result.

The code assumes the input is read from standard input. The first line contains the values of `n` and `k`. The second line contains the number as a string. You may need to modify the code if your input format differs.

Please note that this solution assumes `k` is less than or equal to `n` and that the input number has at least `k` digits.
