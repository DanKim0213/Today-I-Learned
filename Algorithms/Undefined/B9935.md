## Could you solve Baekjoon 9935?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 9935 problem is known as "문자열 폭발" (String Explosion). Here's the Python code to solve it:

```python
def string_explosion(string, bomb):
    stack = []

    for char in string:
        stack.append(char)

        if len(stack) >= len(bomb) and stack[-len(bomb):] == list(bomb):
            # Remove the characters corresponding to the bomb
            for _ in range(len(bomb)):
                stack.pop()

    result = ''.join(stack)

    if result:
        return result
    else:
        return "FRULA"


# Read input values
string = input()
bomb = input()

# Calculate and print the result
result = string_explosion(string, bomb)
print(result)
```

In this solution, we use a stack to simulate the explosion of the bomb in the string. Here's how the code works:

- The `string_explosion` function takes the original string and the bomb string as input and returns the resulting string after the explosion.
- We initialize an empty stack to simulate the characters in the string.
- We iterate through each character in the string:
  - We push the character to the stack.
  - If the length of the stack is greater than or equal to the length of the bomb, and the last characters in the stack match the bomb, we remove the characters from the stack corresponding to the bomb.
- After processing all the characters, we join the remaining characters in the stack to form the resulting string.
- If the resulting string is not empty, we return it. Otherwise, we return "FRULA".

In the main part of the code:

- We read the input values `string` and `bomb`, representing the original string and the bomb string.
- We call the `string_explosion` function with the input values to calculate the resulting string after the explosion.
- We print the result.

The code assumes the input is read from standard input. The first line contains the original string, and the second line contains the bomb string. You may need to modify the code if your input format differs.

Please note that this solution assumes the bomb can be exploded multiple times, and the explosion should be done greedily from left to right.
