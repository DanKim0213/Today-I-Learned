## Could you solve Baekjoon 9084?

Certainly! The problem "Baekjoon 9084," also known as "동전," is a programming problem where you need to calculate the number of ways to make a target value using given coins. The goal is to find the number of combinations.

Here's the Python code to solve Baekjoon 9084:

```python
# Function to calculate the number of combinations
def calculate_combinations(coins, target):
    # Initialize the combination array
    combinations = [0] * (target + 1)
    combinations[0] = 1

    # Calculate the combinations
    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, target + 1):
            combinations[i] += combinations[i - coin]

    return combinations[target]


# Main function to solve the problem
def solve_coin(coins, target):
    # Calculate the number of combinations
    num_combinations = calculate_combinations(coins, target)

    return num_combinations


# Input the number of test cases
T = int(input())

# Process each test case
for _ in range(T):
    # Input the number of coins and the coins' values
    N = int(input())
    coins = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Input the target value
    target = int(input())

    # Solve the problem and print the result
    result = solve_coin(coins, target)
    print(result)
```

In this code, the `calculate_combinations` function takes the list of coin values and the target value as input. It uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of combinations to make the target value using the given coins. The `solve_coin` function takes the input values, calls the `calculate_combinations` function, and returns the number of combinations. The main code reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by inputting the number of coins, the coin values, and the target value, and prints the result for each test case.

You can run this code and provide the input values for the number of test cases, the number of coins, the coin values, and the target value to get the number of combinations for each test case.
