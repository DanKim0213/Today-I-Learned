## Could you solve Baekjoon 13023?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 13023 problem is known as "ABCDE". Here's the Python code to solve it using depth-first search (DFS):

```python
def dfs(adj_list, visited, v, count):
    visited[v] = True

    if count == 4:
        return True

    for neighbor in adj_list[v]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            if dfs(adj_list, visited, neighbor, count + 1):
                return True

    visited[v] = False

    return False


def isABCDE(adj_list):
    n = len(adj_list)

    visited = [False] * n

    for v in range(n):
        if dfs(adj_list, visited, v, 0):
            return True

    return False


# Read input values
n, m = map(int, input().split())

adj_list = [[] for _ in range(n)]

for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    adj_list[a].append(b)
    adj_list[b].append(a)

# Calculate and print the result
result = isABCDE(adj_list)
print(1 if result else 0)
```

In this solution, we use depth-first search (DFS) to check if there is a path of length 5 in the given graph. Here's how the code works:

- The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search starting from a given vertex `v`. It keeps track of the number of vertices visited in the current path using the `count` parameter. If a path of length 5 is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
- We start by marking the current vertex `v` as visited and incrementing the `count`.
- If the `count` is equal to 4 (indicating that we have visited 4 vertices so far), we have found a path of length 5 and return `True`.
- For each neighbor of the current vertex `v`, if it has not been visited, we recursively call the `dfs` function with the neighbor as the new starting vertex and increment the `count` by 1. If the recursive call returns `True`, we propagate the result up and return `True`.
- If no path of length 5 is found from the current vertex `v`, we mark it as unvisited and return `False`.
- The `isABCDE` function iterates through all vertices in the graph and calls the `dfs` function on each of them. If a path of length 5 is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
- In the main part of the code:
  - We read the input values `n` (the number of vertices) and `m` (the number of edges).
  - We create an adjacency list `adj_list` to represent the graph, where each vertex is a list of its neighboring vertices.
  - We iterate `m` times to read the edges and add them to the adjacency list.
  - We call the `isABCDE` function with the adjacency list to check if a path of length 5 exists.
  - We print `1` if the result is `True`, indicating that a path of length 5 exists; otherwise, we print `0`.

The code assumes the input is read from standard input. The first line contains the values of `n` and `m`. The following `m` lines represent the edges, where each line contains two integers `a` and `b`, indicating an edge between vertices `a` and `b`. You may need to modify the code if your input format differs.

Please note that this solution assumes the graph is undirected and does not contain self-loops or duplicate edges.
