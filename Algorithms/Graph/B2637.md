## Could you solve Baekjoon 2637?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 2637 problem, also known as the "Building Assembly" problem, can be solved using a topological sorting approach. Here's a Python implementation for the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

def solve_building_assembly(n, m, edges, indegree, parts, assembly):
    queue = deque()
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if indegree[i] == 0:
            queue.append(i)

    while queue:
        part = queue.popleft()
        for next_part, count in edges[part]:
            indegree[next_part] -= 1
            for i in range(m+1):
                assembly[next_part][i] += assembly[part][i] * count
            if indegree[next_part] == 0:
                queue.append(next_part)

    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if parts[i]:
            print(i, assembly[n][parts[i]])

n = int(input())  # Number of parts
m = int(input())  # Number of building assemblies

edges = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]
indegree = [0] * (n+1)
parts = [0] * (n+1)
assembly = [[0] * (m+1) for _ in range(n+1)]

for _ in range(m):
    x, y, k = map(int, input().split())
    edges[y].append((x, k))
    indegree[x] += 1

for i in range(1, n+1):
    if indegree[i] == 0:
        parts[i] = i
        assembly[i][i] = 1

solve_building_assembly(n, m, edges, indegree, parts, assembly)
```

In this code, we first read the input, including the number of parts (`n`), the number of building assemblies (`m`), and the assembly relationships (`x`, `y`, and `k`).

We initialize the `edges` list to store the directed edges between parts, the `indegree` list to store the indegree of each part, the `parts` list to store the parent part of each part (initially set to 0), and the `assembly` matrix to store the count of each part in each assembly.

Next, we populate the `edges` and `indegree` lists based on the assembly relationships provided. We also initialize the `parts` list by assigning the parts that have an indegree of 0 as their parent part and setting the corresponding value in the `assembly` matrix to 1.

The `solve_building_assembly()` function performs the topological sorting algorithm. It takes the input data, along with the `edges`, `indegree`, `parts`, and `assembly` lists. The function iterates through the parts in topological order, updating the counts in the `assembly` matrix for each part based on its dependencies and the counts of its parent parts.

Finally, the function prints the part number and its count in the final assembly for each part that is considered as a base part.

By using a topological sorting approach, the code efficiently determines the count of each part in the final assembly.
