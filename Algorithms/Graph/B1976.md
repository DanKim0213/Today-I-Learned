## Could you solve Baekjoon 1976?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 1976 problem is known as "여행 가자" (Travel Plan). Here's the Python code to solve it:

```python
def find_parent(parent, x):
    if parent[x] != x:
        parent[x] = find_parent(parent, parent[x])
    return parent[x]


def union(parent, x, y):
    x = find_parent(parent, x)
    y = find_parent(parent, y)

    if x < y:
        parent[y] = x
    else:
        parent[x] = y


# Read input values
n = int(input())
m = int(input())

# Initialize the parent array
parent = [i for i in range(n + 1)]

# Read the city connections and perform union operations
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    cities = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if cities[j - 1] == 1:
            union(parent, i, j)

# Read the travel plan
plan = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Check if all cities in the travel plan belong to the same set
same_set = True
for i in range(m - 1):
    if find_parent(parent, plan[i]) != find_parent(parent, plan[i + 1]):
        same_set = False
        break

# Print the result
if same_set:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

In this solution, we use the union-find algorithm to check if all cities in the travel plan belong to the same set.

First, we define two helper functions: `find_parent` and `union`, which are similar to the ones used in the previous solution. The `find_parent` function recursively finds the parent of a set by path compression, and the `union` function performs the union of two sets.

We initialize the parent array, where each element initially points to itself, representing its own set.

Next, we read the city connections from the input and perform union operations accordingly. For each city `i`, if there is a connection to city `j`, we perform the union of the sets that contain city `i` and city `j`.

After that, we read the travel plan and check if all cities in the plan belong to the same set. We compare the parent of each city in the plan and break if we find any pair that belongs to different sets.

Finally, we print "YES" if all cities in the plan belong to the same set, and "NO" otherwise.

Please note that the code assumes the input is read from standard input. The first line contains the value of `n`, representing the number of cities. The following `n` lines represent the city connections, where each line contains `n` numbers (0 or 1) indicating the presence or absence of a connection. The next line contains the value of `m`, representing the length of the travel plan, followed by `m` numbers representing the cities in the plan. You may need to modify the code if your input format differs.
