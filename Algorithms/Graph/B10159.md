## Could you solve Baekjoon 10159?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 10159 problem is called "저울" (Scale). The problem involves finding the number of objects that can be determined as heavier or lighter in a set of objects.

Here's the Python solution for the Baekjoon 10159 problem:

```python
import sys

def solve_scale(n, m, comparisons):
    # Initialize the adjacency matrix
    graph = [[False] * (n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]

    # Mark direct comparisons in the graph
    for a, b in comparisons:
        graph[a][b] = True

    # Perform transitive closure using Floyd-Warshall algorithm
    for k in range(1, n+1):
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            for j in range(1, n+1):
                graph[i][j] = graph[i][j] or (graph[i][k] and graph[k][j])

    # Count the number of objects that can be determined as heavier or lighter
    results = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        count = 0
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            if not graph[i][j] and not graph[j][i] and i != j:
                count += 1
        results.append(count)

    return results

def main():
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    comparisons = []

    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        comparisons.append((a, b))

    results = solve_scale(n, m, comparisons)

    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

To use this solution, you can provide the input values through standard input. The first line should contain an integer `n` representing the number of objects. The second line should contain an integer `m` representing the number of comparisons. Then, you need to provide `m` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b`, indicating that object `a` is heavier than object `b`.

After running the code, it will output the number of objects that can be determined as heavier or lighter for each object.
