## Could you solve Baekjoon 16562?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 16562 problem is known as "친구비" (Friend Cost). Here's the Python code to solve it:

```python
def find_parent(parent, x):
    if parent[x] != x:
        parent[x] = find_parent(parent, parent[x])
    return parent[x]


def union(parent, x, y):
    x = find_parent(parent, x)
    y = find_parent(parent, y)

    if x < y:
        parent[y] = x
    else:
        parent[x] = y


# Read input values
n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
cost = list(map(int, input().split()))

parent = [i for i in range(n + 1)]  # Initialize the parent array

# Perform union operations
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    union(parent, a, b)

total_cost = 0

# Calculate the minimum cost for each group
group_cost = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    root = find_parent(parent, i)
    group_cost[root] = min(group_cost[root], cost[i - 1])

# Calculate the total cost
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if group_cost[i] != float('inf'):
        total_cost += group_cost[i]

# Print the result
if total_cost <= k:
    print(total_cost)
else:
    print("Oh no")
```

In this solution, we use the disjoint-set (union-find) data structure to group friends and calculate the minimum cost within each group.

We define two helper functions: `find_parent` and `union`, which are similar to the ones used in previous solutions. The `find_parent` function recursively finds the parent of a set by path compression, and the `union` function performs the union of two sets.

We read the input values `n`, `m`, and `k`, representing the number of friends, the number of friend connections, and the maximum budget, respectively. We also read the list of costs for each friend.

We initialize the parent array, where each element initially points to itself, representing its own set.

We perform the union operations based on the friend connections. We iterate `m` times and perform the union operation using the `union` function.

Next, we calculate the minimum cost for each group. We create a `group_cost` array to store the minimum cost for each group. We iterate through the friends and find the root (parent) of each friend using the `find_parent` function. We update the `group_cost` with the minimum cost for each group.

After that, we calculate the total cost by summing up the costs within each group. We iterate through the `group_cost` array and add the non-infinite costs to the `total_cost`.

Finally, we print the result. If the total cost is less than or equal to the maximum budget (`total_cost <= k`), we print the total cost. Otherwise, we print "Oh no".

The code assumes the input is read from standard input. The first line contains the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. The second line contains `n` integers representing the costs for each friend. The following `m` lines represent the friend connections, where each line contains two integers `a` and `b`, representing a connection between friends `a` and `b`. You may need to modify the code if your input format differs.
