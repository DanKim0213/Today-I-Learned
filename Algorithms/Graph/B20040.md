## Could you solve Baekjoon 20040?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 20040 problem is known as "사이클 게임" (Cycle Game). Here's the Python code to solve it:

```python
def find_parent(parent, x):
    if parent[x] != x:
        parent[x] = find_parent(parent, parent[x])
    return parent[x]


def union(parent, x, y):
    x = find_parent(parent, x)
    y = find_parent(parent, y)

    if x < y:
        parent[y] = x
    else:
        parent[x] = y


# Read input values
n, m = map(int, input().split())

parent = [i for i in range(n)]  # Initialize the parent array

cycle_found = False
result = 0

# Process the cycle detection
for turn in range(1, m + 1):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())

    if cycle_found:  # If a cycle is already found, skip processing
        continue

    if find_parent(parent, a) == find_parent(parent, b):
        cycle_found = True
        result = turn
    else:
        union(parent, a, b)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

In this solution, we use a disjoint-set (union-find) data structure to detect cycles in the given graph.

We define two helper functions: `find_parent` and `union`, which are similar to the ones used in previous solutions. The `find_parent` function recursively finds the parent of a set by path compression, and the `union` function performs the union of two sets.

We read the input values `n` and `m`, representing the number of vertices and the number of turns, respectively.

We initialize the parent array, where each element initially points to itself, representing its own set.

We iterate through the turns and process the cycle detection. For each turn, we read the two vertices `a` and `b` and check if they belong to the same set (representing a cycle) using the `find_parent` function. If a cycle is found, we update the result with the current turn and set the `cycle_found` flag to True. Otherwise, we perform the union operation using the `union` function.

If a cycle is already found, we skip processing the remaining turns to optimize performance.

Finally, we print the result, which represents the turn at which the first cycle is detected. If no cycle is found, the result remains 0.

The code assumes the input is read from standard input. The first line contains the values of `n` and `m`. The following `m` lines represent the turns, where each line contains two integers `a` and `b`, representing the vertices connected in the current turn. You may need to modify the code if your input format differs.
