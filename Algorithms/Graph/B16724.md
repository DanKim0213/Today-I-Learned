## Could you solve Baekjoon 16724?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 16724 problem is known as "피리 부는 사나이" (The Devotion of Suspect X). Here's the Python code to solve it:

```python
def find_parent(parent, x):
    if parent[x] != x:
        parent[x] = find_parent(parent, parent[x])
    return parent[x]


# Read input values
n, m = map(int, input().split())
grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]

parent = [i for i in range(n * m)]  # Initialize the parent array

# Perform union operations for adjacent cells
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        cell = i * m + j
        next_cell = None

        if grid[i][j] == 'U':
            next_cell = (i - 1) * m + j
        elif grid[i][j] == 'D':
            next_cell = (i + 1) * m + j
        elif grid[i][j] == 'L':
            next_cell = i * m + (j - 1)
        elif grid[i][j] == 'R':
            next_cell = i * m + (j + 1)

        if next_cell is not None:
            parent_cell = find_parent(parent, cell)
            parent_next_cell = find_parent(parent, next_cell)

            if parent_cell != parent_next_cell:
                parent[parent_next_cell] = parent_cell

# Count the number of distinct groups
group_count = len(set(find_parent(parent, i) for i in range(n * m)))

# Print the result
print(group_count)
```

In this solution, we use the disjoint-set (union-find) data structure to determine the number of distinct groups based on the given movements in a grid.

We define a helper function, `find_parent`, similar to previous solutions, to find the parent of a set by path compression.

We read the input values `n` and `m`, representing the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively. We also read the grid configuration itself as a list of strings.

We initialize the parent array, where each element initially points to itself, representing its own set.

We iterate through the grid cells and perform union operations based on the given movements. For each cell, we calculate the corresponding next cell based on the movement direction. If the next cell is valid, we find the parent of the current cell and the next cell using the `find_parent` function. If they have different parents, we perform the union operation by updating the parent of the next cell.

After performing the union operations, we count the number of distinct groups by finding the number of unique parent sets.

Finally, we print the result, which represents the number of distinct groups in the grid.

The code assumes the input is read from standard input. The first line contains the values of `n` and `m`. The following `n` lines represent the grid configuration, where each line contains `m` characters representing the cells of the grid. The characters can be 'U' (up), 'D' (down), 'L' (left), or 'R' (right). You may need to modify the code if your input format differs.
