## Could you solve Baekjoon 10775?

Certainly! The Baekjoon 10775 problem is known as "공항" (Airport). Here's the Python code to solve it:

```python
def find_parent(parent, x):
    if parent[x] != x:
        parent[x] = find_parent(parent, parent[x])
    return parent[x]


def union(parent, x, y):
    x = find_parent(parent, x)
    y = find_parent(parent, y)

    if x > y:
        parent[x] = y
    else:
        parent[y] = x


# Read input values
g = int(input())
p = int(input())

parent = [i for i in range(g + 1)]  # Initialize the parent array
result = 0

# Process the gates
for _ in range(p):
    gi = int(input())
    root = find_parent(parent, gi)

    if root == 0:  # All gates are occupied, break the loop
        break

    union(parent, root, root - 1)
    result += 1

# Print the result
print(result)
```

In this solution, we use a disjoint-set (union-find) data structure to simulate the allocation of gates at the airport.

We define two helper functions: `find_parent` and `union`, which are similar to the ones used in previous solutions. The `find_parent` function recursively finds the parent of a set by path compression, and the `union` function performs the union of two sets.

We read the input values `g` and `p`, representing the number of gates and the number of planes, respectively.

We initialize the parent array, where each element initially points to itself, representing its own set.

We iterate through the planes and process the gates. For each plane, we read the gate number `gi`. We find the parent (representing the available gate) using the `find_parent` function. If the root is 0, it means all gates are occupied, so we break the loop. Otherwise, we allocate the gate to the plane by performing the union operation using the `union` function and increment the result by 1.

Finally, we print the result, which represents the maximum number of planes that can be allocated a gate.

The code assumes the input is read from standard input. The first line contains the value of `g`, representing the number of gates. The second line contains the value of `p`, representing the number of planes. The following `p` lines represent the gate numbers for each plane. You may need to modify the code if your input format differs.
