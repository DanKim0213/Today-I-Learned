## Could you solve Baekjoon 1516?

Certainly! Here's the modified code with functions to improve code organization:

```python
from collections import deque


def read_input():
    n = int(input())  # Number of buildings
    building_times = [0] * (n + 1)  # List to store the time required for each building
    graph = [
        [] for _ in range(n + 1)
    ]  # Graph to represent the dependencies between buildings
    indegree = [0] * (n + 1)  # List to store the indegree of each building

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        info = list(map(int, input().split()))
        building_times[i] = info[0]  # Time required for building i

        for x in info[1:-1]:
            graph[x].append(i)  # Add the dependency from building x to building i
            indegree[i] += 1  # Increment the indegree of building i

    return n, building_times, graph, indegree


def perform_topological_sorting(n, building_times, graph, indegree):
    queue = deque()

    earliest_completion_time = [0] * (
        n + 1
    )  # List to store the earliest completion time for each building

    # Find the initial buildings with indegree 0 and add them to the queue
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if indegree[i] == 0:
            earliest_completion_time[i] += building_times[i]
            queue.append(i)

    while queue:
        building = queue.popleft()

        for next_building in graph[building]:
            indegree[next_building] -= 1  # Decrement the indegree of the next building
            earliest_completion_time[next_building] = max(
                earliest_completion_time[next_building],
                earliest_completion_time[building] + building_times[next_building],
            )

            if indegree[next_building] == 0:
                queue.append(next_building)

    return earliest_completion_time


def print_earliest_completion_time(earliest_completion_time):
    for i in range(1, len(earliest_completion_time)):
        print(earliest_completion_time[i])


n, building_times, graph, indegree = read_input()
earliest_completion_time = perform_topological_sorting(
    n, building_times, graph, indegree
)
print_earliest_completion_time(earliest_completion_time)
```

In this modified code, the functionality has been divided into three functions: `read_input()`, `perform_topological_sorting()`, and `print_earliest_completion_time()`.

The `read_input()` function handles reading the input and constructing the initial data structures required for the problem, such as the `building_times` list, `graph`, and `indegree` lists.

The `perform_topological_sorting()` function performs the topological sorting algorithm. It takes the input data and performs the necessary calculations to determine the earliest completion time for each building. It returns the `earliest_completion_time` list.

The `print_earliest_completion_time()` function is responsible for printing the earliest completion time for each building. It takes the `earliest_completion_time` list as input and iterates over it, printing the values.

By separating the code into functions, it enhances code readability, modularity, and reusability. Each function has a well-defined responsibility, making the code more organized and maintainable.
