## Comparison: K6 vs Lighthoust

> "Lighthouse is excellent for early feedback and diagnostics to quickly fix any low-hanging-fruit issues with your websiteâ€™s performance. But if you want to measure the web performance and also leverage [a hybrid approach](https://k6.io/hybrid-performance-testing/?pg=blog&plcmt=body-txt) to performance testing, k6 browser is a great tool."

TL;DR; K6 for frontend and backend performance testing while Lighthouse for frontend performance testing.
